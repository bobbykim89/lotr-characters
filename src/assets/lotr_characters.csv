0,,,Female,,,Adanel,Men,,Belemir,"Adanel married Belemir of the House of Bëor; he was a great-grandson of Bëor the Old. Adanel was the mother of five children, and her fifth and last child was a son: Beren.[1] His daughter, Emeldir ""the Man-hearted"", named her son after her father; this child was the renowned Beren Erchamion (Beren the One-handed). Thus, Adanel was the great-grandmother of Beren, son of Emeldir, her granddaughter.
The Wise of the people of Marach were the only Men to preserve the tale of their original sin, when, soon after their awakening, the Men chose to worship Melkor instead of Eru. Adanel told this tale (called the Tale of Adanel in Morgoth's Ring) to Andreth of the House of Bëor.
Andreth was a very distant niece of Adanel's husband Belemir through the line of Baran, the eldest son of Bëor, and Belemir through the line of his grandfather Belen, who was the youngest son of Bëor. In addition, Andreth's nephew Barahir married Adanel's granddaughter Emeldir.[2]",
1,"Before ,TA 1944","Late ,Third Age",Male,,,Adrahil I,Men,,,"Adrahil was born sometime before TA 1944 and was of traceable Númenórean lineage. He served King Ondoher of Gondor as a general during the Wars of the Wainriders in the year 1944.[3]
Adrahil was descended from a Númenórean noble house that settled in Belfalas in the Second Age.[4] Because of this, it is assumed he was an ancestor of Imrazôr, Galador and the Princes of Dol Amroth.[5]
When King Ondoher led his army to face the Wainriders who threatened Gondor, Adrahil commanded the army's left wing. The soldiers of the right wing were under the command of the King's nephew Minohtar, while the centre was commanded by the king himself and his heir Artamir.
Ondoher's enterprise came to a devastating end: he was surprised by the Wainriders near the Black Gate, and his forces were overwhelmed. Adrahil's soldiers, however, were shielded from the attack and survived it. Ondoher and Artamir had both been killed, and Minohtar took charge, sending orders to Adrahil to withdraw with both his own command of the left wing and those at the rear of the right wing who had not yet been engaged.
Adrahil withdrew south into Ithilien to form a defensive line from Cair Andros to the Ephel Dúath. With these forces, he was to cover the approaches to Minas Anor. Adrahil at once messaged Eärnil to inform him of the disaster and of the position of the retreating Northern Army.
Adrahil's fate is uncertain; the Wainriders overwhelmed Minohtar's rearguard defence, but whether they penetrated to Adrahil's position is unknown. If he survived the initial assault, it seems likely that Adrahil would have joined with Eärnil in his counter-attack, seeing the ultimate defeat of the Wainriders at the Battle of the Camp.[6]",

Aegnor was born in Tirion sometime during the Noontide of Valinor.[3] When Fëanor spoke in Tirion, Aegnor was moved by his words as was his brother but neither spoke against their father; however, he and his brothers followed the host of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth.[4] When the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth, he together with Angrod held the northern slopes of the highlands of Dorthonion against Morgoth throughout the time of the Siege of Angband.[5]
Aegnor never married but he was in love with the Bëorian wise-woman Andreth, and she returned his feelings. They spent much time discussing Men and Elves and their fates in the world, which are fully explained in the Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth. However, it was wartime and he did not make his intentions towards her clear enough. He was killed along with his brother soon after when Morgoth broke the Siege at the start of Dagor Bragollach in FA 455.[2]

He took her as his wife against her will, hoping to produce an heir to legitimize his rule as Lord of Hithlum.[1] Aerin secretly helped Húrin's wife Morwen and sheltered Sador, the former servant of Húrin and childhood friend of Túrin.
When Túrin returned to Dor-lómin, he learned from Aerin that his mother had left Hithlum. He became angry and in his rage killed Brodda. While being hunted to the death, one of Túrin's followers saw the Hall of Brodda on fire and guessed that Aerin had kindled it. She burned to death in the fire.

Apparently destitute, he became part of a group of outlaws that raided others for their needs in Brethil and near the borders of Doriath. When Túrin joined the group, Algund eventually recognized him as the son of Húrin.[1] After Túrin slew Forweg, the original leader of the group, it was Algund who supported him as their new captain, figuring that he would be a better leader and lead them to better fortunes.[1][2]
Later, when the group captured Beleg, Androg argued that he should soon be killed for spying, but Algund advised to wait until Túrin returned.[2] He was most likely slain in the Sack of Amon Rûdh.[3]

She cared little for ships and the sea, though her father was a great sailor. She married and gave birth to a son, Aldarion, who soon desired to follow in the footsteps of her father, Vëantur.

When Pharazôn married Tar-Míriel and seized the Sceptre of Númenor, he had been corrupted by his father's counsel, and Pharazôn and Amandil became estranged. As a covert leader of the Faithful in Númenor, Amandil supported the old traditions of friendship with the Elves and reverence for the Valar, while Pharazôn followed the contrary way of the King's Men and his own will. He deprived the Lords of Andúnië of their lordship due to their support of the old King Tar-Palantir and commanded Amandil to dwell in Rómenna. He took Andúnië and made it the chief harbour of his ships but did not remove Amandil from his council or otherwise harm him.
In SA 3261, Pharazôn brought Sauron (who was disguised) to Númenor and, over the years, was deceived by Sauron's lies.
Eventually sensing the impending doom of Númenor, Amandil urged his son Elendil not to interfere in the imminent war but to expect and prepare for a forced departure from the island. He himself decided to set sail for Valinor to plead with the Valar for forgiveness and mercy for the Númenórean people, since at least a few had remained faithful.
He departed into the West either in SA 3310[1] or SA 3316,[1] just before the Great Armament was ready to launch, in an attempt to reach Valinor and save Númenor. He set sail in a small ship with three servants dear to him (though no names are given for them) at night from Rómenna, steering east as if his goal was to reach Middle-earth, but soon he turned and journeyed into the west. He never returned and was not heard from again.
Whether Amandil's voyage was successful is untold, but soon after the destruction of Númenor, a great wave carried Elendil's ships safely to Middle-earth, suggesting that Amandil's pleas had indeed been answered.[2]",

After Eärendur's death, however, Amlaith fell into dispute with his younger brothers, and the descent of the kingship was interrupted. The details of the brothers' disagreements are nowhere recorded, but their result was of historical significance, causing the old North-kingdom of the Dúnedain to be split into three realms. Amlaith's realm was reduced to the lands west of the River Baranduin and the Weather Hills, a region that came to be known as Arthedain. The other lands of Arnor were divided between Amlaith's brothers, creating the new kingdoms of Rhudaur to the east and Cardolan to the south.[1]
Whatever the cause of the dissension between Amlaith and his brothers, the fact of his direct descent from Isildur was never in question. Through Amlaith, the Kings of Arthedain carried the bloodline of Elendil down through the generations. The heirlooms of the House of Isildur; the Ring of Barahir and Sceptre of Annúminas remained in his possession and passed to his descendants. Amlaith broke the traditions of his forefathers and did not take a name in Quenya, the High Tongue of the Elves.

17,Years of the Trees,FA 538,Male,Dark red,,Amras,Elf,Estolad,,"Life in Valinor[]
Amras, and his twin Amrod, were born sometime in the Years of the Trees. Nerdanel initially named both twins Ambarussa and, when Fëanor begged that their names should be different, she then provided Umbarto, though not to any twin specifically. Either disturbed by such an ominous name, or because he misheard her, Fëanor changed it to Ambarto and gave it as the mother-name to Telufinwë, the younger twin.[4] He was deeply attached to his twin brother, and thus they were called ""Ambarussa"". They were nearly identical, being alike in both face and mood,[5] but the younger twin, Amrod, had a darker shade of red hair after childhood and was dearer to Fëanor.[4]
Twins were very rare among the Eldar, with Amras and Amrod being the only case recorded in the ancient histories until the later children in the line of Dior.[6] Fëanor and his sons abode seldom in one place for long, but traveled far and wide upon the confines of Valinor, going even to the borders of the Dark and the cold shores of the Outer Sea, seeking the unknown. They were often guests in the halls of Aulë.[5]
During the unrest of the Ñoldor and the strife between Fëanor and his half-brother Fingolfin, Fëanor was banished from Tirion and took up residence in Formenos; he was followed by his father, King Finwë, and his sons.[7] Along with Finwë, the sons of Fëanor did not attend the high feast and were out riding when Formenos was attacked by Melkor and Ungoliant after the pair had killed the Two Trees. They attempted to return, but as they approached they were thrown from their horses. Once the cloud passed, they entered Formenos and found Finwë dead, the house ravaged, and the Silmarils stolen. They then sped to the Ring of Doom where Maedhros informed Manwë and, unknowingly, Fëanor who kept himself hidden during the conversation. Fëanor reacted by cursing both Melkor and the summons of Manwë, and then fleeing into the night; the sons of Fëanor followed him, dismayed that he might slay himself.[8]
Fëanor and his sons soon returned to Tirion where, during a great speech by Fëanor, they took a terrible oath of enmity and vengeance against all or any who dared to claim any right in the Silmarils, and led most of the Ñoldor into exile. As Fëanor was preparing his host for Exile and to return to Middle-earth, Nerdanel approached him and begged that he should leave her youngest twin sons, or at least one of them.[4] Fëanor rejected this, and stated that by deserting him (in not joining the Exile) she was deserting all their children as well.[4] Nerdanel retorted that he would not keep all of them, and at least one would never set foot on Middle-earth.[4]
To obtain the ships needed to pursue Morgoth into Middle-earth, Fëanor's host seized them from the Falmari, killing many when they resisted, and thus came under the Doom of Mandos. After a long march northwards, the Ñoldor drew close to the Helcaraxë, a land bridge deemed impassable, and the narrow strait between Aman and Middle-earth they intended to sail. With too few ships remaining to ferry all the Ñoldor at once, and the fear of treachery between their houses, Fëanor and his sons stole away in them, abandoning the host of Fingolfin.[9]
Return to Middle-earth[]
In the morning after the Burning of the Ships at Losgar, Amras noticed the absence of his twin brother Amrod. He explained that Amrod was restless and did not sleep on the ground out of discomfort. He was the last to speak about this matter to Fëanor.[4]
Fëanor's host traveled north and encamped on the northern shore of Lake Mithrim where they were attacked unaware by a host of Morgoth. In the battle that followed, Fëanor's forces were swiftly victorious, and pursued the routed orcs over the Mountains of Shadow into Ard-galen.[10]
Later, Amras and his brothers rescued their father who died in an ambush after Dagor-nuin-Giliath.[11] After Fëanor's death, he settled the wide plains of East Beleriand between the rivers Celon and Little Gelion where few folk dwelt, and took it as his realm and hunting-ground. He became renown as a great hunter of the woods, though not more than Celegorm.[5] Amras had little direct involvement with the Siege of Angband,[12][13] but he was present at each kinslaying. If his brothers needed aid or shelter, he supported them. Amras died during the attack made by the Sons of Fëanor on the Havens of Sirion in 538.[14]",

Amrod and his younger brother, Amras, were born during the Years of the Trees in Valinor. In the rebellion of the Ñoldor, Amrod and his brothers swore the Oath of Fëanor.[2] Before they left for Middle-earth, Nerdanel Amrod's mother begged Fëanor to leave her two youngest son with him or at least one of them. Fëanor refused her, and Nerdanel prophesied that one of them will not set foot on Middle-earth. In fact, Amrod died during the Burning of the ships at Losgar.[3]
In accordance to The Silmarillion, Amrod and his six brothers rescued their father during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath.[4] He had also held the lands of Estolad with his brother.[5] In FA 538, Amrod and Amras died during the Third Kinslaying at the Havens of Sirion.[6]",
19,,TA 1981,Male,Golden,,Amroth,Elves,Lórien,Nimrodel,"Third Age[]
When Amroth's father, Amdír, was killed in the Battle of Dagorlad in SA 3434, Amroth became King of Lothlórien. He would be the last of the ruling Sindar over Lórien.
Amroth and Nimrodel[]
Amroth's beloved, the elf-maiden Nimrodel, resented that Elves from Beleriand were being admitted into Lothlórien due to Morgoth's aggression against that place. She believed that these foreign Elves brought wars and destroyed the peace that Lothlórien's inhabitants had once enjoyed. When a Balrog was awakened in Moria by the delvings of the Dwarves and they fled north to the Lonely Mountain, many of the Elves living on the west side of Lórien moved inward, and the Galadhrim tightened their guard. Nimrodel, living on the west side of the forest by the stream that afterward bore her name, preferring not to mix with the Galadhrim who she deemed invaders of the golden wood, instead fled to Fangorn Forest in TA 1981 (Third Age). Amroth followed her to the forest, which was much closer to Lothlórien than it later became. Upon attempting to enter the forest, Nimrodel was halted and badly frightened by the movements and murmurings of the Black Huorns who barred her entrance. She lingered on the edge of the forest, unsure of what to do. Amroth found her there a day later.
There, Amroth and Nimrodel spoke long and earnestly with one another, Amroth begging for her favor. Eventually, the Elf-Maiden promised that she would marry Amroth only if he brought her to a peaceful land.
Amroth vowed that he would leave the Elves of Lothlórien, even if a time came when they needed him most. However, none of Middle-earth was at peace and Amroth believed that the Elves would never enjoy peace again. He suggested that he and Nimrodel should travel across the Sundering Seas to the Undying Lands.
Amroth knew that the Sindarin Elves had come to the Bay of Belfalas, a haven south of Lothlórien, long ago. Although the majority of those Elves had left Middle-earth and sailed to the Undying Lands, Amroth was aware that some of their kind still built ships and offered passage to any of the other Elves wishing to leave Middle-earth. After Amroth made the necessary arrangements, he and Nimrodel left Lothlórien.
However, they somehow became separated on their journey. Amroth looked for Nimrodel, but his search was unsuccessful so he continued south towards the Sundering Seas.
Fate[]
At the havens on the Bay of Belfalas, Amroth found that the few remaining Sindarin Elves who remained in Middle-earth were preparing to leave aboard the only seaworthy ship that they had. Although they welcomed Amroth aboard, they were unwilling to wait for Nimrodel. They hoped that she was in Gondor and that she had not attempted to cross the White Mountains, where many unfriendly Men lived.
The summer was almost over and it would soon be autumn, which was expected to bring dangerously strong winds. However, the Elves saw that Amroth was extremely upset. They had removed all their possessions from their houses on the shore, so they waited with Amroth on their ship for many weeks. Summer passed and autumn came, but Nimrodel still did not arrive.
One night, one of the fiercest storms in the recorded history of Gondor came from the Northern Waste, swept through Eriador and caused an enormous amount of destruction to Gondor. Many of the ships that the Men of Gondor had built were swept away from the coast and sank. The wind broke the light Elven-ship from its moorings and hurled the vessel far from the Bay of Belfalas, driving it towards the coasts of Umbar.
At dawn of the following morning, the storm dissipated. However, when Amroth awoke, he saw that the ship was already far from its port. Full of despair, Amroth screamed Nimrodel's name, threw himself into the water below and drowned.
The ship was never seen again in Middle-earth, although it is likely that the vessel left the Circles of the World and eventually reached Tol Eressëa, an island that the Eldar used to enable them to complete the Great Journey.
Neither Elves nor Men ever saw Amroth or Nimrodel again, but there were many legends concerning Nimrodel's fate.
Legacy[]
NImrodel shared her name with a stream where she once lived, that indirectly flowed into the Bay of Belfalas. According to Elven legend, Amroth's voice continued to emanate from the Sea, and Nimrodel's voice often resonated from the stream of Nimrodel.[3][4]",

However, after slaying a woman, he was hunted and fled southward. Being an archer, he then joined Gaurwaith, a band of outlaws that hunted the forests south of the River Taeglin, and was remembered as ""the grimmest among them"".
When Túrin first appeared among the outlaws and slew one of their men, Andróg quickly perceived both Túrin's superiority and the Curse of Morgoth that followed him. Despite this, he esteemed Túrin and became one of his closest followers. Later, Túrin spared Andróg despite his participation in Forweg's attempt to trap Larnach's daughter, and Andróg supported him in becoming the leader of the band. After Beleg was captured by the outlaws, Andróg urged them to kill him, coveting Beleg's bow, Belthronding, and showed no favor to the Elf even after his release by Túrin.
Andróg was foremost in the attempt to capture the Petty-dwarves, seizing Mîm and shooting arrows at his sons. Once again, he wished to slay Mîm immediately, despising all Dwarves, and doubted his gift of Amon Rûdh. Andróg was cursed by Mîm when it became known that his arrow slew Khîm:

""He that loosed the shaft shall break his bow and his arrows and lay them at my son's feet; and he shall never take arrow nor bear bow again. If he does, he shall die by it.""
—Mîm
Andróg obeyed, fearing the Dwarf's curse, but prophesied in reply that Mîm would ""lack a bow at need ere his end"". Some time afterward, Andróg took up his bow and arrows again and was wounded by a poisoned shaft. He was healed by Beleg at Túrin's bidding but continued to mistrust the Elf. Mîm's curse, however, was not put to rest. In fact, this act made Mîm even angrier, as all Petty-dwarves hated Elves with a passion.
During the Sack of Amon Rûdh, Andróg led some of the band to the top of the hill by a secret stair he had discovered some time before. There, he fought more valiantly than any but fell mortally wounded by an arrow. His son, Andvír, however, survived the battle.[1]

It was later mentioned that he and four thousand men arrived at Minas Tirith around the time Aragorn and the Army of the West left for the Black Gate. It was Aragorn who named Angbor ""the Fearless"".[1]",

Along with his brothers and sister, they were the few princes of the West permitted to enter Doriath through their mother Eärwen of Alqualondë.
With Aegnor, he held the northern slopes of the highlands of Dorthonion against Morgoth. Angrod and Aegnor were both killed in the Dagor Bragollach.

He married a Ñoldorin lady named Eðellos. His son was Orodreth.[1]",
30,,,Male,,,Annael,Elves,,,"Annael was born in Beleriand, probably during the Years of the Trees.[citation needed] He was the leader of a small band of Grey-elves living in the Mountains of Mithrim, having the Swan-wing[2] as his heraldic token.[1]
He fought in the First Battle of Beleriand, one of the first wars of the First Age. After the Noldor's return to Middle-earth, he fought under Fingolfin and Fingon at Dagor Aglareb, the Siege of Angband, the Battle of the Firth of Drengist, Dagor Bragollach, and the Second Assault on Hithlum.[citation needed]
After the Union of Maedhros was formed in the year 468,[3] Annael led a small force of the Grey-elves of Mithrim to take part in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad in the year 472[4]. Annael was the only survivor of from that company who returned to Mithrim. While Rían was hosted by the Grey-elves at Lake Mithrim during the birth of her son Tuor, she asked them to foster him, as she wished to leave and search of her husband Huor. Annael explained to her how Huor had died, and she left the dwelling and went northwards to die on the Haudh-en-Ndengin. Thus, Annael became the foster-father of Tuor during his early years.[1]
As the years passed, in order to seek refuge from the Easterlings and the Orcs, Annael led his small group of people to Androth. In the year 488, when Tuor was sixteen, Annael had to prevent him from going to fight against the enemies of the House of Hador, foreseeing that Morgoth's power would not be defeated until Thangorodrim was overthrown, and that they had to escape south through the Annon-in-Gelydh, which was built long before by King Turgon's people. Tuor was much intrigued by the name of Turgon and wished to meet him, but Annael told him how well hidden Turgon's realm was. Despite having parted in secret from Androth, Annael's people were located and ambushed by a large force of Orcs and Easterlings under their chief Lorgan. The Elves were all scattered, and Tuor was captured and taken as a slave. However, Annael and many of his folk survived the attack and escaped Dor-lómin. Annael and his people eventually joined Círdan at the Havens of Sirion in the distant south of Beleriand.[1]
While it is untold what Annael's fate was, it is likely that, if he survived the Third Kinslaying and the War of Wrath, he either heeded Eönwë's call and sailed to the Undying Lands, or he remained with Círdan in Lindon.[5] If he remained in Middle-earth, then he may have fought in the Siege of Eregion, the Siege of Lindon, the First Siege of Imladris, the Battle of the Gwathló, the War of the Last Alliance, the Weather Hills skirmishes, the Fall of Fornost, and the Battle of Fornost. During the War of the Ring, he went to Lothlórien to aid and he fought in the First Battle of Lórien, the Second Battle of Lórien, the Third Battle of Lórien, and the Destruction of Dol Guldur. After the defeat of Sauron, he sailed to Valinor in the Fourth Age.[citation needed]",
31,SA 3219,SA 3440,Male,,,Anárion,Men,Gondor,Unnamed wife,"Origin[]
Anárion was born in the year 3219 of the Second Age in Númenor. He and Isildur lived at the haven of Rómenna on the east coast of the island of Númenor. Their father was Elendil son of Amandil, the Lord of Andúnië.
In SA 3262, Ar-Pharazôn took Sauron captive and brought him to Númenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken because he wanted to corrupt the Númenóreans. He used their desire for power to convince them to renounce Eru and worship Morgoth. As Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave Númenor. They filled nine ships (two for Anárion) with many of their prized possessions, including the palantíri.[1]
Sauron's lies convinced Ar-Pharazôn that he could achieve power in the Undying Lands. In SA 3319, Ar-Pharazôn set out with a great fleet intending to take the Undying Lands by force but when he set foot on the shore, Eru caused the Seas to open up. The fleet sank and Númenor was destroyed by a great wave.[1]
Founding of Gondor[]
The ships of the Faithful were spared, and a great wind from the west sent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north, whilst Isildur and Anárion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the south. Elendil established the Northern-kingdom of Arnor and his sons the Southern-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the King of both realms, but he dwelled in Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor to his sons.[2]
Anárion made his home in Minas Anor on the western side of the Anduin, while Isildur lived in Minas Ithil on the eastern side, Osgiliath was their joint capital. Anárion had one of the palantíri, which he used to communicate with his brother and father.[1]
War of the Last Alliance[]
When Sauron and the forces of Mordor attacked Gondor and captured Minas Ithil in SA 3429, Isildur and his family were forced to flee to Annúminas in Arnor. After the loss of Ithilien, Anarion gathered an army and defended Osgiliath from Sauron, driving the enemy out of Ithilien and returning Minas-Ithil the following year. In the meantime the Last Alliance of Elves and Men was formed and Sauron's forces were defeated in the Battle of Dagorlad. The army of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and laid siege to the Barad-dûr. The siege lasted seven years and many Men and Elves were killed; Anárion was slain in SA 3440 when a stone cast from Barad-dûr, either from falling debris or by catapult, struck him.[1][3]
His father Elendil later fought Sauron but fell to him in battle, while his brother Isildur would be the one to cut the One Ring from the Dark Lord's hand with their father’s broken sword. Before departing from Gondor, Isildur planted a seedling of the White Tree of Gondor in Minas Anor in memory of his brother.
Two years later, Anárion's son Meneldil became the third King of Gondor. All the subsequent Kings of Gondor would be descended from him, and although his male line descendants would become extinct with the disappearance of Eärnur, his bloodline continued in the House of Isildur via Fíriel.",
32,SA 2709,SA 2962,Male,,,Ar-Adûnakhôr,Men,Númenor,Unnamed wife,"As an opponent of the Valar, Ar-Adûnakhôr's Quenya name was recorded in the official royal scrolls only. The name he chose was considered by some as blasphemous in both languages, as it means ""Lord of the West"", a title reserved for Manwë, King of the Valar. During his time, the Elven-tongues were no longer used or taught to children, and the ships from Tol Eressëa came rarely. Only those of The Faithful maintained the ancient customs of friendship with the west and welcomed the Eldar, both in secret.[2]
The persecution of the Faithful began under Ar-Adûnakhôr's reign, and he punished those who openly spoke Elven tongues. After this, the Eldar ceased to travel to Númenor.
There is some question as to whether Ar-Adûnakhôr succeeded his father, Tar-Ardamin, as king, or his grandfather, Tar-Calmacil, but the numbering of the rulers includes Tar-Ardamin in the count. Specifically, Tar-Ardamin does not appear at all in the The Lord of the Rings appendices, but he does appear in the chapter The Line of Elros: Kings of Númenor from Unfinished Tales.
Ar-Adûnakhôr ruled for sixty-three years and was succeeded by his son, Ar-Zimrathôn in SA 2962.[1]",
33,SA 2960,SA 3177,Male,,,Ar-Gimilzôr,Men,Númenor,Inzilbêth,"Ar-Gimilzôr's reign was a difficult time for the Faithful (Elendili), who called for the return of the Númenóreans to the ways of the Valar and the Elves, for during this time he persecuted them for their beliefs. Use of the Elvish languages was forbidden in Númenor by his order in SA 3110. He also neglected the White Tree and no longer made pilgrimage to the Hallow of Eru. In fact, he was so distrustful of the Faithful that he forced them to move from Andúnië to the eastern part of the island near Rómenna, and watched them carefully.[2]
Ar-Gimilzôr's wife, Inzilbêth, was secretly an Elf-friend, and she passed on her ways to their son, Tar-Palantir. She was the daughter of Lindórië, who was herself a descendant of Tar-Elendil, the fourth King of Númenor, and also of Tar-Calmacil. Their second son, Gimilkhâd, opposed his elder brother's policies.[1]",
34,SA 3118,Still alive,Male,,Tall,Ar-Pharazôn,Men,Númenor,Tar-Míriel,"Ar-Pharazôn was the son of Gimilkhâd, leader of the King's Men during the reign of Tar-Palantir of Númenor. He grew into a man of great will, strength, and stature, and in early years was a good friend of his distant kin Amandil, future Lord of Andúnië and leader of the Faithful. However, he was raised deeply in the ways of the King's Men, a faction to soon become the Faithful's adversary.
In time, Ar-Pharazôn was a very proud man, gradually desiring wealth and glory. He grew restless in his homeland, and so went often abroad, leading like-minded Númenóreans in wars against Men of Middle-earth's coasts whom Númenor had begun to seek control of. In this he fared well on both land and sea, winning great respect as a captain and great wealth, wherefore his fame in Númenor grew also.
Upon the death of his uncle, Tar-Palantir, who had no son, Ar-Pharazôn decided to wed his daughter, Míriel, against her will and against Númenórean law. As Tar-Míriel was the rightful Ruling Queen of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn was able to usurp the throne. He gave to his wife the name Ar-Zimraphel, refusing to use the Elven speech, whilst persecuting the last vestiges of the Faithful.
As time passed, it came to his attention that Sauron, the Lord of Mordor, was expanding his power throughout Middle-earth and was being called the Lord of Men. Ar-Pharazôn, ever prideful, resolved to challenge him for lordship of the earth. In SA 3261, he marched upon Mordor with an army so powerful that Sauron's forces simply deserted him. But Sauron was cunning, and he feigned to be overawed at Ar-Pharazôn's might. The king did not trust Sauron, and brought him back to Númenor as a hostage. However, Sauron quickly took advantage of his situation to gain Ar-Pharazôn's trust, and by way of careful flattery, lies and half-truths, he soon became the king's closest and most trusted advisor. He was able to corrupt Ar-Pharazôn, deceiving him to worship Morgoth (Sauron's former master) in the hope that he would be able to cheat mortality, though Sauron was well aware that this would not grant him immortality. Some results of Sauron's manipulations, deceptions and cunning were the erecting of a great Temple for Morgoth, intense persecution of the Faithful, and the chopping down of the White Tree of Númenor. Soon, the king and his followers worshiped Morgoth openly and burned innocents at the altar of the temple as sacrificial offerings to appease the false god, unaware they were being lied to and deceived by Sauron.
Then, as Ar-Pharazôn felt the bite of old age upon him, Sauron was able to deceive him to attack Valinor and claim the right to immortality by force. He began the building of a huge fleet, the Great Armament, to attack Valinor in SA 3310; and for nine years, his men toiled on the western coasts of Númenor in the making and training of a great host of war. In this way he became the most powerful tyrant in Arda since the days of Morgoth himself, though in truth Sauron ruled all from behind the throne. In fact, so great was the power of his fleet that it was said that they might have been able to overthrow the Valar themselves, had they reached Valinor.[3] Finally in SA 3319, he and his great force set sail for the west, breaking the Ban of the Valar and coming to the shores of the Undying Lands after thirty-nine days at sea. When he first gazed upon Taniquetil, shining white as snow yet as terrible as the might and supremacy of Eru Ilúvatar himself, even he, Ar-Pharazôn, the mighty King of Men and of the seas, became afraid and nearly turned back. Despite all that he saw, neither fear nor wisdom would prevail, for pride was the master of the king and so he was resolved to go onward. He led his troops onto land, passing through the Calacirya. Here he proclaimed the land his if no one would challenge him for it. Then, by nightfall, he led his men to the hill of Túna and made camp there.
The Valar then laid down their guardianship of the world and called upon Eru, the One. By mid-morning, he sank Ar-Pharazôn's fleet and all of Númenor beneath the ocean, changing the shape of the world. Valinor was no longer connected to Middle-earth, and mortals could no longer find it. Afterwards, only Elves and a few remarkable exceptions could reach it, following the Straight Road into the far west. Ar-Pharazôn and his mighty host who landed on Aman were buried by mounds of dirt, and remain in the Caves of the Forgotten until the last battle, or Dagor Dagorath. He and his great army's role in the end of days has not been made clear.

Legacy and successors[]
Ar-Pharazôn's tyrannical rule and rebellious resolve to break the Ban of the Valar and make war upon the west led to the end of the royal Númenórean line and of Númenor itself. Instead, the House of Elros was continued from the long line of the Lords of Andúnië, begun through Elros' great-granddaughter Silmariën and her son Valandil, the first Lord of Andúnië. As Amandil of Andúnië did not return from his venture into the west, his son Elendil became the founder of new kingdoms created in Middle-earth in exile. Elendil's two surviving sons, Isildur and Anárion followed him into exile and their descendants would rule as Kings for thousands of years. Ar-Pharazôn was remembered by the surviving Númenórean lineage with a sort of grudging respect. Despite his errors, he was the first and last Man capable of beating and humiliating the powerful dark lord Sauron by himself. In remembrance to this feat, a great white pillar was erected in Umbar to the Golden King of Númenor: a dark crystal globe, on a tall white column, which absorbed and radiated the sun's rays and glimmered in the night for everyone to see. The monument was destroyed by the Corsairs of Umbar after Sauron's return to Mordor in the late Third Age.[1][4][5][6]",
35,SA 2876,SA 3102,Male,,,Ar-Sakalthôr,Men,Númenor,Unnamed wife,"Ar-Sakalthôr followed the royal tradition of turning away from the ways of the Valar. He succeeded his father Ar-Zimrathôn as King, ruling Númenor for sixty-nine years, and was succeeded by his son, Ar-Gimilzôr. The traditional Quenya version of his name was Tar-Falassion.
Ar-Sakalthôr died in SA 3102, living to the age of two-hundred and twenty-six. He ruled Númenor for sixty-nine years and was succeeded by his son, Ar-Gimilzôr.[1]",
36,SA 2798,SA 3033,Male,,,Ar-Zimrathôn,Men,Númenor,Unnamed wife,"Like his father Ar-Adûnakhôr, Ar-Zimrathôn opposed the Valar, and he took his name in the Adûnaic tongue rather than in the traditional Quenya. But Númenórean scholars recorded his Quenya name Tar-Hostamir in the Scroll of Kings so as not to break with tradition. His name in both languages means ""Jewel Gatherer"", perhaps implying a greedy nature.
Ar-Zimrathôn died in SA 3033, living to the age of two-hundred and thirty-five and ruled Númenor for seventy-one years, and was succeeded by his son, Ar-Sakalthôr.[1]",
37,TA 2820,TA 2930,Male,"Dark, then grey (film)",,Arador,Men,,Unnamed wife,"Arador descended in direct line from Aranarth being born in TA 2820.[1] He took the chieftainship in TA 2912 after his father Argonui died.[3]
During the time of his reign, the majority of the Dúnedain lived in the Angle of Eriador. Arador himself lived in a house by the Hoarwell in some woods north of the Trollshaws. During his reign, Trolls began to make dens in the mountains and hills of the Ettenmoors. A band of these trolls threatened Arador's house in the Angle.[4]
While not yet old by the account of the Dúnedain of the North, Arador was captured by Hill-trolls in the Coldfells north of Rivendell, and was slain by them.[5] These trolls may have been the same ones that threatened his house. He was succeeded by his son, who led the Dúnedain of the North and the Rangers of the North as Arathorn II, and was in turn succeeded by his own son Aragorn II, the future King of Gondor and Arnor.[2]",

Aragorn I's reign came to an early end when, in TA 2327, he became ""lost in the wilderness"" while hunting.[2] It was later said in history that he was probably slain by the Wolves infesting Eastern Eriador,[2] which remained an ever increasing danger in Eriador, even up to the Fourth Age.[4]
After his early death, he was succeeded by his son, Araglas, who became the sixth Chieftain of the Dúnedain.[3]",

He was Aragorn son of Arathorn, the nine and thirtieth heir in the right line from Isildur, and yet more like Elendil than any before him.—The Silmarillion, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age
Aragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur through the line of the Lords of Andúnië to Elendil, High King of Arnor and Gondor. Like all of the kings before him, he was Elrond's kin through the House of Elros.  His ancestor Arvedui was wedded to Fíriel, descended from Anárion, who bore their son Aranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant of both Isildur and Anárion.
When he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while pursuing Orcs. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond. At the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn was renamed ""Estel"" and was not told about his heritage until 2951.[1]
Young Aragorn with the shards of Narsil, by Anna Lee
Elrond revealed to ""Estel"" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, giving him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil, but withholding the Sceptre of Annúminas from Aragorn until he ""came of the right"" to possess the item. It was also around this time that Aragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of Lothlórien where she had been visiting her grandmother Galadriel.[1]
Aragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of the Dúnedain and left the comforts of Rivendell for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his people, the Rangers of the North, whose kingdom had been destroyed through division and the Angmar Wars centuries before.[1]
Aragorn met Gandalf the Grey in 2956 and they became close friends. Heeding Gandalf's advice, Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small land known as the Shire inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian Hobbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the Shire's borders as Strider.
From TA 2957 to TA 2980, Aragorn undertook great journeys, serving in the armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor. Many of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the growing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he earned priceless experience which he would later put to use in the War of the Ring. Aragorn served these lords in disguise and his name in Gondor and Rohan during that time was Thorongil (""Eagle of the Star""). With a small squadron of ships from Gondor, he led an assault on the long-standing City of the Corsairs in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' ships and personally overthrowing the Captain of the Haven during a battle upon the quays. After the victory at Umbar, ""Thorongil"" left Gondor and, to the dismay of his men, went east.[2]
Later in 2980, he visited Lothlórien, and there once again met Arwen. He gave her the heirloom of his House, the Ring of Barahir, and, on the hill of Cerin Amroth, Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage, renouncing her Elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of Ilúvatar: Death.[1]
Elrond withheld from Aragorn permission to marry his daughter until such a time as his foster son should be king of ""both"" Gondor and Arnor. As both Elrond and Aragorn knew, to marry a mortal, Arwen would be required to choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless Elrond of his daughter while the world lasted. Elrond was also concerned for Arwen's own happiness, fearing that in the end she might find death (her own and that of her beloved) too difficult to bear.[1]
Before the events of The Lord of the Rings properly take place, Aragorn traveled widely through Middle-earth, entering the Dwarven mines of Moria via the East-gate of Moria but exiting the same way. He also journeyed to Harad, where (in his own words) ""the stars are strange"". Tolkien indicated that these travels occurred after TA 2980, but does not indicate what happened during Aragorn's visits.
In TA 3009, Gandalf grew suspicious of the origin of the Ring belonging to the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, which later turned out to be the One Ring, the key to the Dark Lord Sauron's power. Setting a guard of Rangers on the Shire, Aragorn went at Gandalf's request into Rhovanion in search of Gollum, who had once possessed the Ring. He caught the creature in the Dead Marshes near Mordor, and brought him as a captive to Thranduil's Halls in Mirkwood, where Gandalf questioned him.[3] Gollum, however, escaped some time later with the aid of Sauron's Orcs.

Escorting the hobbits
Aragorn returned with Gandalf in the spring of TA 3018, and then went away on his own journey, and was not able to help when Gandalf discovered the Nazgûl were seeking for Frodo and the Ring in the Shire. After Frodo left Hobbiton, Gildor Inglorion informed Aragorn that the Nine were looking for him and Gandalf was missing. Aragorn continued to watch the Great East Road until Tom Bombadil and the four hobbits came from the Barrow-downs. Following them to Bree, he met Frodo at the Inn of the Prancing Pony under the name ""Strider,"" as the Men of Bree called him.[4] Though originally the hobbits were suspicious of him, Barliman Butterbur brought a letter from Gandalf that made them trust him.[5] Aragorn was aged 87 at that time, nearing the prime of life for one of royal Númenórean descent.
After the raid on Bree, Aragorn led the Hobbits out of Bree-land and through the Midgewater Marshes. While there, he saw Gandalf's battle with the Nazgûl on Weathertop from a distance. When they themselves came to Weathertop, they discovered five of the Nazgûl had followed them, and during the later attack he fought off the Ringwraiths. After attempting to heal Frodo with athelas, he led them across the Lone-lands towards the Trollshaws.[6] They met with the Elf-lord Glorfindel who led them to the Ford of Bruinen. When the Nazgûl caught up with them and Elrond released a flood, Aragorn and the Hobbits kindled fire and flushed out those Nazgûl that had remained on the western bank. He then accompanied Frodo to Rivendell.[7]

During the feast of victory, Aragorn was gathering news from Elladan and Elrohir, and later helped his friend Bilbo compose his Lay of Eärendil. During the Council of Elrond, he revealed himself to Boromir as the heir of Isildur and described his capture of Gollum. After Elrond decided that the Ring must be destroyed in Mordor, Frodo took the burden upon himself. There, Aragorn chose to join Frodo, thus forming the Fellowship of the Ring, tasked with accompanying Frodo in destroying the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Besides Aragorn, Gandalf, and Frodo, the company included Frodo's cousins Pippin and Merry, his best friend Samwise Gamgee, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Boromir of Gondor.[3]
All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be Blade that was Broken,
The crownless again shall be king.
— Bilbo's poem about Aragorn[5]
Before the group set out, the shards of Narsil were re-forged, and the restored blade was named Andúril.
Accompanying the Fellowship
Aragorn and Gandalf had been planning their journey to Mordor for weeks. He and Gandalf guided the Fellowship south along the line of the Misty Mountains. When they came to Hollin, Aragorn grew suspicious due to the lack of any sound he heard and spotted the Crebain who were spying out the land for Saruman. He then convinced Gandalf to try the pass over Caradhras. However, while they were still far down the mountain, they were caught in a freak storm brought on by Sauron, and were forced to retreat. Aragorn, together with Boromir, made a path through the snow for the Fellowship to escape.
Aragorn the Ranger in the wild, in the fan film The Hunt for Gollum
After it was proposed to go through Moria, Aragorn reluctantly agreed to go and helped fight off the Wargs that attacked them during the night. Helping to rescue Frodo from the Watcher in the Water, once the company entered Moria, Aragorn remained at the back and noticed Gollum beginning to follow them. After they were attacked in the Chamber of Mazarbul, Aragorn fought off the attackers and killed the Orc-Chieftain, (or Cave-troll in the movies) that had seemingly killed Frodo. During Gandalf's battle with the Balrog on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, Aragorn ran to his side and became the Fellowship's leader after Gandalf fell, presumed dead.[8] Aragorn then led the company to Lothlórien, where he visited Cerin Amroth for the last time. At their parting, Lady Galadriel gave him the Elfstone.[9]
After Lórien, Aragorn and the Fellowship sailed down the River Anduin to the Falls of Rauros. Aragorn attempted to catch Gollum several times. Though his original plan was to set out for Gondor and aid its people in the war, he felt responsible for Frodo after the loss of Gandalf and was conflicted about what path to take.[10]
Breaking of the Fellowship
Fear not! he said. ""Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses of Isildur and Anarion, my sires of old. Under their shadow Elessar, the Elfstone son of Arathorn of the House of Valandil Isildur's son heir of Elendil, has naught to dread!— Aragorn proclaiming his lineage[10]""
After passing the Argonath, the Fellowship camped at Parth Galen. Frodo saw that Boromir had been driven mad by the influence of the One Ring, trying to take it. Frodo put the Ring on, rendering him invisible, and ran away from Boromir. Frodo climbed to the high seat on Amon Hen; from there he could see Sauron's eye looking for him. The Hobbit felt the eye but the Dark Lord was distracted by Gandalf the White.

At this same time, the others were attacked by Saruman's Uruk-hai and a battle ensued. During the ensuing battle, Boromir was killed defending Merry and Pippin, expressing his remorse privately to Aragorn for trying to take the Ring. After discovering that Frodo had left, Aragorn and the others decided that they would leave Frodo and Sam to rescue Merry and Pippin. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn put Boromir's body and war gear in one of the Elven boats as a funeral boat and tribute to Boromir for his bravery and courage. His body would be sent over the Falls of Rauros.[11]
While Frodo continued his quest with Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli went to Rohan to free Merry and Pippin, who had been captured by the Uruk-hai in Saruman's service.
The Three Hunters
Aragorn ran from Parth Galen across the width of Rohan in just four days. As they approached Fangorn Forest, the ""Three Hunters"" Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli encountered Éomer, who had recently pursued and routed an Orc-band in the area. From Éomer, Aragorn learned that the Orcs who had kidnapped Merry and Pippin had been destroyed and that the Hobbits had not been found. Dejected, he led Legolas and Gimli to the site of the battle. Clues led Aragorn to believe that the Hobbits might still be alive, and he led the Three Hunters into Fangorn Forest.[12] They did not find the Hobbits, but they did find Gandalf the White, sent back to continue his struggle against Sauron. Gandalf told the Three Hunters that the Hobbits were safe with the Ents of Fangorn.[13]
The Three Hunters, by Ted Nasmith
Where now are the Dunedain, Elessar, Elessar?
Where do thy kinsfolk wander afar?
Near is the hour when the lost should come forth,
And the Grey Company ride from the North.
But dark is the path appointed to thee:
The Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea.
- Galadriel's message to Aragorn[13]
The Battle of Hornburg
Together, Gandalf and the Three Hunters travelled to Edoras, where Gandalf freed Théoden from Saruman's enchantment and helped him organize the Rohirrim against Saruman.[14] He allied with Théoden and joined the king's Éored, journeying to Helm's Deep.

Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli then helped the people of Rohan in the Battle of the Hornburg, in which they conclusively defeated Saruman's army.[15] Afterward Aragorn went with Gandalf to Isengard, only to find it in ruins by the work of the Ents. Aragorn, being present with Gandalf, Théoden, Éomer, Legolas and Gimli, negotiated in a final parley with Saruman. Saruman attempted to bend Théoden to his will, and at first the king was almost swayed, but mastering his will he refused to join with Saruman. Saruman also attempted to sway Gandalf, but failed in this also, and even so Gandalf offered his counterpart the opportunity for forgiveness. Saruman refused to repent out of pride and to avoid seeming a rebel to Sauron, and thus Gandalf broke Saruman's staff and banished him from the Order of Wizards and the White Council. After Saruman crawled away, Gríma Wormtongue threw the palantír of Orthanc at Gandalf as he and the others were leaving. He missed, however, unable to decide if he hated Saruman or Gandalf more, and thus ended the Battle of the Hornburg and the destruction of Isengard. After Pippin revealed himself to Sauron in the stone, Gandalf gave the palantír to Aragorn.[16]
Not long after the Grey Company of Rangers arrived from the north, dispatched by Galadriel. With them rode Elladan and Elrohir and Halbarad, bearing a standard made for him by Arwen. When Aragorn returned to Helms Deep, he decided to draw Sauron out and used the palantír to show himself and Andúril to the Dark Lord, wrenching the Stone to his will after a long struggle with the Dark Lord. However, this led Sauron to swiftly send out the forces he had long prepared to attack Minas Tirith.
Return of the King
Aragorn with the Army of the Dead
In order to defend the city, Aragorn travelled the Paths of the Dead, and summoned the Dead Men of Dunharrow who owed allegiance to the Heir of Isildur. It had been prophesied by Isildur and Malbeth the Seer that the Dead would be summoned once more to pay their debt for betraying Gondor an age before. With their aid the Corsairs of Umbar were defeated at the Battle of Pelargir.[17]
Aragorn, a small force of Rangers, and a large contingent of men and soldiers from the southern regions then sailed up the Anduin to Minas Tirith. When they arrived at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Aragorn unfurled a standard that Arwen had made for him which showed both the White Tree of Gondor along with the jeweled crown and seven stars of the House of Elendil. With the help of the southern forces the armies of Gondor and Rohan rallied together and defeated Sauron's army.[18]
The Steward Denethor II declared that he would not bow to a descendant of Isildur (years before, he had seen ""Thorongil"" as a rival to his father's favor and soon discovered his true identity) and burned himself to death during the battle, despairing of final victory. Aragorn healed Faramir, Denethor's last heir, Éowyn and Merry, who together slew the Witch-king as well as many others. This won him the immediate recognition of Faramir as rightful heir to the throne; his humility and self-sacrifice gained him the hearts of the inhabitants of Gondor's capital city. Aragorn's healing abilities, moreover, were a sign to the people of Gondor of the identity of their true king; as Ioreth said, ""The hands of the King are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known."" The people hailed him as King that same evening.[19]
Aragorn Captain of the West
Despite his immediate success and popularity, however, and despite his claim to the throne through raising the royal banner, Aragorn decided to lay aside his claim for the time being. He knew that if he aggressively promoted his claim, rival claimants or debates as to his legitimacy were not out of the question, and this could be a fatal distraction for Gondor at a time when the West needed to be united against Sauron. So, to avoid conflict, after he had healed people during the following nights of March 15–16, he left Minas Tirith and symbolically refused to enter it again until he was crowned King on May 1.
Captain of the West
Aragorn then led the Army of the West to Mordor as per the advice of Gandalf and Elrond, to divert Sauron's attention from Frodo and Sam. They marched over the Anduin river and came to Minas Morgul, and set fire to the fields there. Leaving a guard at the Cross-roads of the Fallen King, they began to march north along the North Road of Ithilien, and Aragorn won a skirmish against some Orcs and Easterlings that tried to ambush them. They then reached the desert before Mordor, and Aragorn allowed those who were afraid to depart to retake Cair Andros. The Army of the West then reached the Black Gate, and Aragorn along with Gandalf, Éomer, Imrahil, Pippin, Legolas and Gimli rode up to it and called for Sauron to come forth. He then watched as the Mouth of Sauron revealed Sauron knew about Frodo and Sam, and saw Gandalf's rejection of Sauron's terms. The Host of the West was then encircled by Sauron's forces, a vast army of Orcs and Men. Aragorn then arranged the Army of the West defensively on two Slag-hills and the Battle of the Morannon began.
After the destruction of the Ring and the defeat of Sauron, Aragorn freed the slaves of Núrn and gifted them the entire land in southern Mordor.
As King of Reunited Gondor and Arnor
Then Faramir stood up and spoke in a clear voice: “Men of Gondor, hear now the Steward of this Realm! Behold! One has come to claim the kingship again at last. Here is Aragorn, son of Arathorn, chieftain of the Dúnedain of Arnor, Captain of the Host of the West, bearer of the Star of the North, wielder of the Sword Reforged, victorious in battle, whose hands bring healing, the Elfstone, Elessar of the line of Valandil, Isildur's son, Elendil's son of Númenor. Shall he be king and enter into the City and dwell there?"" And all the host and all the people cried yea with one voice.—Faramir the Steward announces the coronation of King Elessar
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, King of Gondor
Upon Sauron's defeat, Aragorn was crowned as King Elessar, a name given to him by Galadriel and adopted by the people of Gondor because of the Elfstone he wore. He became the twenty-sixth King of Arnor, thirty-fifth King of Gondor, and the first High King of the Reunited Kingdom, though it would be several years before his authority was firmly re-established in Arnor. His line was referred to as the House of Telcontar (Telcontar being Quenya for ""Strider""). Aragorn married Arwen shortly afterwards, and ruled the Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor until 120 of the Fourth Age. His reign was marked by great harmony and prosperity within Gondor and Arnor, and by a great renewal of cooperation and communication among Men, Elves, and Dwarves, fostered by his vigorous rebuilding campaign following the war. Aragorn led the forces of the Reunited Kingdom on military campaigns against some Easterlings and Haradrim, re-establishing rule over all the territory that Gondor had lost in previous centuries.
During his coronation, Aragorn spoke Elendil's Oath: ""Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!"" (""Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place, I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world."")[20]

End of Reign and Death
Then a great beauty was revealed in him, so that all who after came there looked on him in wonder; for they saw that the grace of his youth, and the valour of his manhood, and the wisdom and majesty of his age were blended together. And long there he lay, an image of the Kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.— Description of Aragorn's death.[1]
Aragorn's funeral
When in the year 120 of the Fourth Age, King Elessar realised his days were at an end, he went to the House of the Kings in the Silent Street. He said farewell to his son Eldarion and his daughters and gave Eldarion his crown and sceptre. Arwen remained at Aragorn's side until he died. A year after Aragorn's death, Arwen died in Lothlórien of a broken heart. Eldarion began his reign as the second King of the Reunited Kingdom after his father's death.[1]",

45,TA 1938,TA 2106,Male,,,Aranarth,Men,,Unnamed wife,"Aranarth was born in TA 1938 to Arvedui and Fíriel. In his youth, the Witch-king of Angmar was at the height of his power and destroyed the Northern Kingdom, overrunning its capital city Fornost. Most of the surviving people, including Aranarth, fled to Lindon, but King Arvedui went north to the Icebay of Forochel. Aranarth urged Círdan to send ships to rescue Arvedui, but the ship never returned. It was later learned that the ship had sunk with Arvedui on board as well as the palantíri of the north.[2]
By right, this made Aranarth now King of Arnor, but since the kingdom was lost he decided not to claim the title. Aranarth rode with the army of Gondor under Eärnur and saw the destruction of Angmar. Aranarth's people became known as the Rangers of the North and he was the first of their Chieftains who dwelt in the wilds of Eriador. In time, their origins were generally forgotten by the remaining people of Eriador.[2]
While the Rangers defended Arnor from the remnants of Angmar's evil, the Wizard Gandalf went to Dol Guldur, and drove out Sauron the Necromancer. Thus began the period known as the Watchful Peace, a time where attacks by the enemy were few and far between. Aranarth's son Arahael was born in Rivendell, and was given a name with the prefix of Ar(a)-, which means King, to signify that by right he would be King of Arnor.

49,TA 1789,TA 1964,Male,,,Araphant,Men,Arthedain,Unnamed wife,"Araphant, the son and heir of King Araval, ascended to the throne in TA 1891 following his father's death. During his reign, the well-known seer Malbeth made a prediction regarding the fate of his son Arvedui, stating that he would be the last king of Arthedain; and as such, he advised Araphant to name his son Arvedui, meaning""last king"". Malbeth's prophecy included a choice for the Dúnedain: if they took the less hopeful path, Arvedui would not change his name and would remain the last king, leading to much sorrow and many lives lost until the Dúnedain were united again.
For some five hundred years, Arthedain had held off the constant attacks of the evil realm of Angmar. Araphant continued fighting off these attacks with failing strength.[3]
During his time, the rulers of Arthedain and Gondor became aware that a force was conducting coordinated attacks on the exiles of Númenor. Araphant therefore renewed contact with Gondor and forged an alliance with King Ondoher, leading to a marriage between Ondoher's daughter Fíriel and Araphant's son Arvedui. Four years later, King Ondoher died during an attack by the Wainriders, and Arvedui made a claim for the throne of Gondor by right of his blood connection to Isildur and his wife Fíriel, who by the laws of Númenor should have become the Ruling Queen. This claim was denied by Gondor, and the kingship of Gondor passed to Eärnil II.
Araphant died in TA 1964 after ruling for seventy-three years and was succeeded by his son Arvedui.[2]",
50,TA 1391,TA 1589,Male,,,Araphor,Men,Arthedain,Unnamed wife,"Araphor was the son of Arveleg I and came early to the throne of Arthedain. While he was still in his youth (probably no more than eighteen years old), the Witch-king of Angmar launched a mighty invasion of his kingdom, that came close to destroying it. Araphor's father Arveleg fought in the defence of the Tower of Amon Sûl, and his early death in that battle brought Araphor to the throne.
Records of the events of this time are incomplete, but it seems that the Witch-king laid siege to the royal city of Fornost. The young Araphor went to war with aid from Círdan and the Elves of Lindon, and succeeded in relieving the siege and driving back the forces of Angmar.
After Araphor's defeat of Angmar, there is no record of further warfare during his long reign. Nonetheless, he ruled a diminished and dwindling people; the wars of his youth had seen the Northern Dúnedain come close to destruction. Rhudaur was now ruled by Angmar, and the Dúnedain of Cardolan were all but extinct.
During these wars many Stoors (Hobbits) fled from Eriador and returned to Wilderland, and became the river people of Sméagol and Déagol.

During his rule, a great and perilous Long Winter arrived in TA 2759, which fell upon Eriador and took the lives of many. Gandalf and the Rangers had to help the Hobbits of the Shire live through it.

His rule was largely an uneventful one, as the Dúnedain and other peoples of Eriador were recovering from the Long Winter.
At the southern fringes of his realm, great events occurred: the Dwarven King Thrór was slain by Azog, an Orc of Moria. From TA 2793 – TA 2799, the War of the Dwarves and Orcs was fought all through the Misty Mountains, as Dwarves from all Seven Houses gathered to avenge Thrór, the Heir of Durin.
After the War ended in TA 2799 at the Battle of Azanulbizar, Eriador was safe from Orcs for many years, which meant that the Rangers of the North had a relatively safe period, aside from fighting the occasional Orc refugee. Most Orcs fled south to Rohan, trying to settle the White Mountains. Arathorn died in TA 2848 when he was attacked by Wolves, and he was followed by his son Argonui.

We are also told that he attempted the recolonization of Cardolan, though this was prevented by the evil beings, the wights, sent there by the Witch-king some two centuries before.
In the end, though, Araval's bravery counted for little. His grandson Arvedui, who was born in Araval's lifetime and just thirteen years after his great victory, was to see the final destruction of the kingdom of Arthedain.

However, she reached Himlad safely and waited there to meet Celegorm, who was abroad. Eventually, out of boredom, she wandered and became lost in the forest of Nan Elmoth.

Arvedui married Fíriel, daughter of King Ondoher of Gondor, who was killed in TA 1944. At Ondoher's death, Arvedui sent messages to Gondor claiming the throne as a direct descendant of Isildur, but he was refused: the Men of Gondor appointed the general Eärnil (a descendant of Anárion) as King instead. Arvedui became King of Arthedain twenty years after, and in TA 1974 Angmar attacked again and captured Fornost. Gondor sent help in the form of a great fleet, but it came too late: Arthedain was destroyed, and Arvedui fled north to the Blue Mountains.
After several months spent hiding in old Dwarf mines, Arvedui was driven by hunger to the Icebay of Forochel. Círdan of Lindon sent a ship north to rescue him, and, against the advice of the Snowmen of Forochel, Arvedui boarded it and was drowned in a storm. Two of the Northern palantíri were lost in the shipwreck, but the Ring of Barahir was spared as Arvedui had loaned it to the Lossoth in gratitude for their aid.

The army from Gondor under Eärnur managed to destroy Angmar with help of Círdan, but Arthedain and all of Arnor were no more, and the kingship had ended. Arvedui died in TA 1975 after ruling for ten years and his son Aranarth became the first of the Chieftains of the Dúnedain.[1]
Thus the prophecy became the truth, for Arvedui was indeed the last King of Arnor, and likewise the line of the Kings of Gondor also ended with Earnil's son Eärnur. The realms were not reunited until over a thousand years later, when Aragorn II became King Elessar. Arvedui's claim was never forgotten by his descendants, though it would be centuries before Aragorn invoked the claim.[2]",

During his father's reign, Arvegil saw events that would shape the history of Middle-earth, including the foundation of the Shire. He was eighty-three years old (no great age for one of the Dúnedain) when the Great Plague came out of the south and ravaged Eriador, but the seat of the Kings at Fornost in the north was little affected.
Arvegil lived for one hundred and ninety years, longer than any of his descendants until Aragorn, as is noted in the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings. By the standards of his own ancestors, though, this was an early death. Of all the northern Kings before Arvegil - excepting those slain in battle - only two had lived less than two hundred years: his father Argeleb II and his grandfather Araphor.

Arveleg swiftly struck back in alliance with the Men of Cardolan and drove back the invading hordes for a time. For more than fifty years, Arveleg maintained a constant guard stretching from the Weather Hills, along the Great East Road, to the lower reaches of the river Hoarwell. Due in large to the defensive prowess of the Men of Arthedain and Cardolan, Angmar was temporarily pushed back and besieged Rivendell.
It was not until TA 1409 that Angmar gathered its forces and was able to breach the frontier. Crossing the River Hoarwell, its armies marched westward and surrounded Weathertop. Arveleg and many of the defenders were slain and the watchtower was burned and razed. The surviving Dúnedain were able to save the palantír of Amon Sûl and retreated to the capital city of Fornost. After this Rhudaur was fully occupied by evil men subject to Angmar and those of Númenórean blood who still remained there were slain or fled west. Cardolan was ravaged and the kingdom destroyed.

Arwen was born in TA 241, to Lord Elrond and Lady Celebrían of Rivendell.[1] Like her father and brothers, she had the right to choose between immortality or mortal life. She lived most of her life in Rivendell and Lothlórien interchangeably.
Third Age
Aragorn and Arwen
Aragorn and Arwen ""plight their troth""
During Aragorn's twentieth year, he met Arwen for the first time in Rivendell, where he lived under Elrond's protection. Arwen, then over 2700 years old, had recently returned to her father's home after living for a while with her grandmother Galadriel in Lórien. Aragorn fell in love with Arwen at first sight, and at first mistook her for Lúthien, thinking he had fallen into a dream.[4]
Arwen, by Anna Kulisz
About thirty years later, the two were reunited in Lórien, where Arwen reciprocated Aragorn's love and they ""plighted their troth"" (promised themselves to each other) on the mound of Cerin Amroth, Arwen choosing to become mortal and to stay in Middle-earth with Aragorn, and giving up the chance to sail over the sea and live forever in the Blessed Realm. Elrond would, however, not permit the two to marry until Aragorn had taken the thrones of Arnor and Gondor, the price for Arwen's abandonment of immortality. Arwen never broke faith with Aragorn, even when he went to war. While the War in the South raged on, Arwen wove a banner for Aragorn, which would become his standard after he became king.
Before taking the Paths of the Dead, Aragorn was met by the Grey Company, consisting of Rangers of the North, and Arwen's brothers, Elladan and Elrohir. They brought to him a banner of black cloth: the gift made by Arwen, and a sign that encouraged him to take the difficult path.[5] When the banner was unfurled at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields to reveal the emblems of Elendil in mithril, gems, and gold, it was the first triumphant announcement of the King's return.
After the War
Queen Arwen and King Aragorn Elessar are wed in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Arwen arrived at Minas Tirith after Aragorn had become King of Gondor and Arnor, and they married on Midsummer's Day in the year TA 3019, after the end of the War of the Ring. She became Queen of the Reunited Kingdom. After marrying Aragorn, she bestowed upon Frodo Baggins a gift; her place on the ships to Valinor. She bore Aragorn's son, Eldarion, and several unnamed daughters, some time in the Fourth Age.
Fourth Age
In the year 121 of the Fourth Age, one year after Aragorn's death, Arwen died of a broken heart at Cerin Amroth in Lórien and was buried there.[2] She was 2901 years old and had been wed to Aragorn for 122 years.

He was also known as Atanatar Alcarin, ""Atanatar the Glorious,"" (alcarin being the Quenya word for glorious), but the deeds of Atanatar weren't as glorious as his appellation would indicate. Atanatar made no effort to expand or maintain the power that his father commanded and the guard on Mordor was neglected. Therefore, his reign is seen as the start of Gondor's decline.

They would often steal mushrooms from Farmer Maggot's farm Bamfurlong.[1]

In TA 2980, when Frodo was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a boating accident on the Brandywine River. An only child, Frodo stayed in Brandy Hall until his 99-year-old ""uncle"" Bilbo, his father's second cousin, adopted him in TA 2989. Bilbo took Frodo to live with him in his home at Bag End and made him his heir.[2]
The two grew very close in the following years; Frodo, treated by his adopted guardian as he were his own son, learned much of the Elvish language during his time with Bilbo, as well as much of the lore of Middle-earth. They also had a weekly tradition of taking long walking trips together from Hobbiton to Michel Delving and Buckland; all throughout the Shire. The two shared the same birthday, September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), and a party of special magnificence was held when Frodo came of age of thirty-three and Bilbo achieved the notable age of 111.
Bilbo gave a memorable birthday speech before playing a joke on his fellow hobbits by using the One Ring to disappear, at which Gandalf quickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash where Bilbo had been standing. The hobbits at the party were left confused and disgruntled, and Bilbo was never again seen in the Shire.
Frodo with Bilbo during his 111th birthday
Before departing for his journey to Rivendell, Bilbo was persuaded by Gandalf to voluntarily surrender the One Ring. Bilbo left it on the fireplace mantel with a note for Frodo, who would now become the next Ring-bearer.
""The Inheritance"", by Raoul Vitale
Coming of age & flight from the Shire
After the party finished, Frodo returned home and discovered that he was now the master of Bag End and the recipient of Bilbo's magic Ring. Gandalf, ever more curious about the Ring's origin, power, and purpose (but not yet positive it was the One Ring), advised the young hobbit against the using the Ring. For the next seventeen years, Frodo complied with the wizard's request and hid the Ring in a safe place. However, on April 12, 3018, Gandalf returned to Bag End and warned Frodo that the Ring was actually the One Ring, which the Dark Lord Sauron needed to rule over Middle-earth. Realizing that Sauron would be looking for the Ring, Gandalf advised the Hobbit to secretly follow Bilbo's journey to Rivendell.
After Frodo's discussion with Gandalf, a rumor started that he was running out of money. This rumor, though not begun by Frodo, was encouraged by him. Merry helped Frodo to purchase a small house at Crickhollow. With the exception of his gardener Sam Gamgee, who had agreed to accompany him to Rivendell, Frodo told the other Hobbits of the Shire that he intended to move to Buckland. He sold his home to the Sackville-Bagginses, and, on the September 23, 3018, the day after his fiftieth birthday, Frodo left from Bag End, taking with him Sam and Pippin. They left in the early morning for Bree, and just in time, as Sauron's most powerful servants, the nine Nazgûl, had entered the Shire dressed as Black Riders searching for a hobbit with the name of Baggins.
To Bree
Frodo was nearly captured by a Black Rider on the road, but was saved by Gildor Inglorion, whom he asked for advice. Leaving the roads to cut across country, Frodo and Sam reached Farmer Maggot's farm, who helped them to evade the Riders. Meeting Merry at Bucklebury Ferry, they saw a Rider tracking them from the bank they'd departed from. On arrival at Crickhollow, Frodo found that Merry and Pippin already knew about his ""secret"" journey. Frodo was left with no alternative but to bring the two youngsters with him. They cut through the Old Forest and the Barrow-downs in hopes of losing the Black Riders, which did succeed. They met other troubles in those places though, at the hands of Old Man Willow and the Barrow-wights, but were rescued twice by Tom Bombadil, a mysterious being who dwelt in a glade in the middle of the Old Forest.
Strider
Frodo meeting Strider at The Prancing Pony
In Bree, the hobbits stayed at The Prancing Pony, an old inn. Frodo went by the name of Mr Underhill, attempting to raise as little suspicion as possible. When he noticed a mysteriously cloaked Man sitting in the shadows and smoking a long-stemmed pipe, Frodo asked the innkeeper, Barliman Butterbur, who the man was. The innkeeper referred to the man, a Ranger, as Strider.
That night, Black Riders arrived in Bree and attacked the inn in search of Frodo and the One Ring, but Strider had managed to hide the Hobbits from them in time. Having gained their trust, Strider introduced himself as Aragorn to Frodo and the others, to whom he also revealed the backstory of the black riders, also called Nazgûl or Ringwraiths. With a pony named Bill that the Hobbits had acquired at Bree, Strider led Frodo and his companions into the Wild. Aragorn would be their guide to Rivendell, and he would lead them through the Midgewater Marshes and to the hill of Weathertop.
Weathertop
On the night of October the sixth, the Hobbits were attacked by five of the nine Ringwraiths at Weathertop. In the presence of the Nazgûl, Frodo made the mistake of putting on the Ring. He was able to resist their attempt to take him by drawing his sword and invoking the name of one of the Valar, Elbereth Gilthoniel. Unfortunately, the leader of the Nazgûl, the Witch-king of Angmar, stabbed Frodo in the shoulder (he would have stabbed his heart) with a Morgul-knife. If it had caught him in the heart, Frodo would have become like the Nazgûl, only weaker and under their control. The Ringwraiths were driven away by the appearance of Aragorn and his martial skill; also because he had torches, one of their few weaknesses.
Though Aragorn was a skilled healer, he could not heal Frodo's wound. A fragment of the Ringwraith's blade remained in Frodo's flesh, where it continued to move towards his heart. Near death (or worse), Frodo was rescued by Glorfindel, an Elf-lord, who put the injured Hobbit upon his horse Asfaloth. They were found and pursued by the Nazgûl, as Glorfindel rode and bore Frodo swiftly to the Ford of Bruinen, at the entrance to the valley of Rivendell. Once they had crossed the River Bruinen, the Nine Ringwraiths behind them demanded Frodo give up the Ring, but Frodo refused. Subsequently, the Ringwraiths entered the river and were washed away in a flood called up by Elrond.
The Hobbits reuniting in Rivendell
Frodo was soon healed in Rivendell by Elrond, who knew the wound would not ultimately leave him, as it was both spiritual and physical. On the 24th of October 3018, Frodo awoke in Rivendell and was reunited with Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Although Elrond had healed his wound, it continued to ail him yearly for as long as he lived in Middle-earth.
Quest of the Ring
Council of Elrond
Frodo placing the One Ring before the Council of Elrond
After his healing, Frodo was summoned to a great Council that Elrond had organized. Representatives of all the Free Peoples of Middle-earth discussed the history of the Rings of Power and decided that the One Ring must be destroyed. As the Ring was shown and tempers flared, argument broke out as to who should carry the Ring on this mission, until Frodo bravely volunteered to take the Ring to Mordor and cast it into the fires of Mount Doom. A member of each of the Free Peoples offered to join Frodo in his quest, thus forming the Fellowship of the Ring.
The Fellowship consisted of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Boromir of Gondor, Legolas of the Woodland Realm, and Gimli of the Lonely Mountain. Before leaving Rivendell, Bilbo gave Frodo his dwarf-made coat of mithril mail and his elven blade Sting. The mithril coat had been given to Bilbo by Thorin Oakenshield during the events of The Hobbit, and Sting had been taken by Bilbo from a troll den. On December 25, the Fellowship of the Ring departed from Rivendell and headed south.
Moria
The Hobbits of the Fellowship of the Ring prepare to battle goblins in Moria
After an attack by White Wolves in Eregion, on January 11, 3019, the Fellowship attempted to cross the Misty Mountains (specifically the Pass of Caradhras), but were unable to due to a snowstorm. They instead traveled through the underground city of Moria at the urging of Gimli.
Some days in into their dangerous trek through Moria, the Fellowship entered the Chamber of Mazarbul, and was attacked by Orcs and a cave-troll. Frodo helped to defeat the troll before he was stabbed by an Orc captain, his mithril-shirt saving him from a deadly blow. The Fellowship then ran from there to the Bridge of Khazad-dum, at which Gandalf dueled Durin's Bane and fell. Once outside Moria, while the Fellowship was grieving, Gimli took Frodo and Sam to look upon the Mirrormere, even in their great hurry.
Lothlórien
Galadriel and Frodo
Deeply grieved by their loss, the Fellowship journeyed to the Elven kingdom of Lothlórien, where they met the Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn. Galadriel showed Frodo a vision of the future in her Mirror. Frodo offered her the One Ring, but she resisted the temptation to take it, passing the test that was laid before her, and accepting the diminishing of the power of the Elves. Before the Fellowship departed from Lothlórien, Galadriel gave each member a gift. To Frodo, she gave a phial with the light of the star Eärendil captured inside; this gift would prove hugely important later on in the quest. They were also provided with elven way-bread, other supplies, and boats for their voyage down the Anduin River.
The Breaking of the Fellowship
Frodo puts on the One Ring to hide from Boromir, near Amon Hen
The Fellowship continued their journey south to Parth Galen. There, Boromir, a Man of Gondor and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to convince Frodo to bring the Ring to Minas Tirith and regroup from there. When the hobbit asked for an hour alone to consider his options, Boromir followed him. Seeing that Frodo did not intend to take the suggested course of action, Boromir tried to take the Ring from him by force.
Frodo put on the Ring and escaped to the Seat of Seeing, where he watched as war brewed across Middle-earth and the Eye of Sauron searching for him as he traveled. He was nearly spotted, but the Dark Lord's attention was drawn away by a resurrected Gandalf.
Taking off the Ring, he decided to take the item to Mordor alone, without telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was joined by his friend Samwise Gamgee, who felt it was necessary that he should protect and guide Frodo. Frodo gave in to Sam's protests, and although reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have Sam's company.
The two hobbits continued toward Mordor, dividing the Fellowship. Meanwhile, Boromir was killed by Uruk-archers while defending Merry and Pippin; the two young hobbits were then captured by Uruk-hai, and were to be taken to Isengard. Instead of following Samwise and Frodo to Mordor, the Three Hunters, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, decided it more important to rescue Merry and Pippin from their captors. The breaking of the Fellowship was now complete.
Emyn Muil
Frodo and Sam journey towards Mordor
After leaving what remained of the Fellowship at Amon Hen, Frodo and Sam tried to navigate through the winding paths and razor sharp rocks of the Emyn Muil. After getting lost several times, they were found by Gollum, who at first tried to take the One Ring, but was captured by Sam (with Frodo's help) and tied up with the Elven rope. Frodo, now pitying the creature, decided not to slay Gollum, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude to the master of the precious. Gollum then led them out of the maze and into the Dead Marshes.
The Dead Marshes
Frodo amid the Marshes
The Dead Marshes lay to the south of Emyn Muil, and were just as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route through the marshes, as Orcs marched for miles around, although Gollum had secretly discovered a path when traveling. He led Frodo and Sam on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them not to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.
Soon after Frodo, Samwise, and Gollum entered the Dead Marshes, a Nazgûl flew over them on a Fellbeast, looking for the Ring. Gollum had led the two hobbits to a safe place that they could hide in.
Ithilien
Gollum led the two Hobbits to the Black Gate of Mordor, as Frodo had desired, but stopped the Hobbits from passing its doors, as the danger was too great. He then explained about a secret way into Mordor, 'Up the stairs and through the tunnel'. The Hobbits once again found themselves being led by Gollum. After venturing into Ithilien, and witnessing a skirmish between a company of Haradrim warriors (along with Oliphaunts) and Rangers from Gondor, they were apprehended by the Ranger's captain, Faramir. When the skirmish had ended, Faramir blindfolded the ring-bearer and his companions and led them to Henneth Annûn, the Window on the West. Upon much interrogation, Sam foolishly misspoke, and gave away that Frodo was indeed carrying the One Ring. Realizing the importance of the quest, Faramir proved his quality, unlike his brother, Boromir, and let the Ring-bearer go free, resupplying the hobbits with food for their journey. Later, Gollum was captured in the Forbidden Pool and forcibly taken into the hidden lair. Frodo begged for his safety, and he was not killed, although the rift between master and servant had once again begun to open.
Frodo, weary, with Sam and Gollum on the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, by Stephen Hickman
Minas Morgul and Shelob's Lair
Gollum led the hobbits past the lair of the Witch-king of Angmar, Minas Morgul, and up the Stairs of Cirith Ungol into 'The Tunnel'. When they arrived at the top though, they were abandoned by Gollum, causing them to realize that Gollum had betrayed them. They cautiously traveled through the tunnel, and managed to get to the end only to find their way barred by Shelob's great web. Whilst attempting to cut through the webbing, Frodo bravely stood up to Shelob and forced her back further into the tunnels giving him and Sam time enough to hack through the threads and escape. Upon escaping the tunnels, Frodo thought himself safe; however, Shelob, through one of her many tunnels, managed to sneak out and jab him with her stinger. As he was being encased in Shelob's webbing, Sam was able to draw her into single combat wherein he, using Sting and the Phial of Galadriel, was able to mortally wound her and drive her back into her caves. Sam took the Ring from around Frodo's neck upon hearing Orcish voices, and hid behind some nearby rocks. He overheard the Orcs speaking of Frodo, and Sam realized that his master was not dead, but merely paralyzed. Frodo was then taken to the Tower of Cirith Ungol to await further torture and questioning.

Cirith Ungol
Frodo was imprisoned on the highest floor of the Tower. He was stripped of all his clothes and possessions. Fighting broke out amongst the two lead Orcs and their battalions from squabbling over claim of the mithril vest - in this violence almost all Orcs and Uruks in the tower died. Sam soon arrived at the gate of the Tower, only to find his way blocked by the Two Watchers; he eventually overcame them, entered the tower, finding and rescuing his master. They descended and fled the tower, having to pass the Watchers again (this time, destroying them), and entered Mordor.
Mordor and Mount Doom
Frodo and Sam crawled onward through the plains of Mordor, which lay vacant as many hosts of Orcs were sent to the Black Gate to meet the Men of the West's army, and, after falling in and out of one such company of Orcs, started to climb Mount Doom. They journeyed on for days with little food or water, and Frodo became progressively weaker as the Ring's power over him grew the closer they drew to Orodruin. Frodo was eventually unable to go on, and Sam was forced to carry him a fair distance. It was then that Gollum reappeared, and, after a brief struggle, Sam cut Gollum in the stomach while Frodo fled up the mountain to its entrance.
Frodo missing a finger
Inside the Cracks of Doom, Frodo finally had the chance to destroy the Ring and relieve his burden, but the Ring's power was at its strongest due to the surroundings where it had been created. Frodo finally yielded to the temptation and power of the Ring. Sam yelled for Frodo to destroy it, but Frodo, overcome by its power, claimed the Ring for himself aloud. Gollum attacked Sam, who fell and hit his head on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When he regained consciousness, he saw Gollum fighting with an invisible Frodo. Gollum bit off Frodo's finger that wore the Ring, causing Frodo great pain, and he was reunited with his treasure for a short time, until, dancing with joy, he toppled off the brink and fell into the lava, destroying himself and the One Ring.
Sam and Frodo after the completion of their quest
The two hobbits tried to escape as Mount Doom erupted. In the very moment that they believed themselves doomed, Gwaihir the Lord of Eagles saw them, and, with his Eagle companions Landroval and Meneldor, rescued Sam and Frodo, and flew them westward, out of Mordor to safety.
End of the War
The Scouring of the Shire
After recovering at the Field of Cormallen and witnessing the crowning of Aragorn as King Elessar, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin all returned to the Shire. Arriving, they found it under the control of one Sharkey (later revealed to be Saruman) and his forces. Saruman was ruling the Shire from Bag End, although he was later murdered by Gríma Wormtongue. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, however, started to gather all Shirriffs and townsfolk of the Shire, and they successfully defeated of Saruman's Ruffians at the Battle of Bywater.
Frodo was not directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of Bywater; instead, he made sure that no hobbits were harmed (saying that no Hobbit had ever intentionally harmed another in the Shire, and that this would stay true), and also that any Ruffians that surrendered were not harmed.
Close of the Third Age
Following the Scouring of the Shire and end of the War of the Ring in November, Frodo went on to serve as Deputy Mayor of the Shire. During his brief tenure of six months, he helped lead the rebuilding of the Shire, but soon realized that he still bore the wounds of his quest. On May 1st, TA 3020, Frodo attended the wedding of his best friend Sam and his wife Rosie Cotton and they moved in with him at Bag End. On mid-years day later that year, Frodo retired from his post as Deputy Mayor, letting the office revert to Will Whitfoot, who Frodo held place for as he recovered from his wounds and imprisonment by Saruman.
During his last days in middle-earth, he tried to live as peacefully as possible. Frodo was still troubled by his shoulder wound, which pained him on each anniversary of the attack at Weathertop, in addition to falling sick on each anniversary of being stung by Shelob. As such, October 6th of that year, he would suffer from his wounds again. March 13th, TA 3021 brought similar ailments, Frodo being ill from his stinging. While living with Sam and Rosie he would witness the birth of their oldest daughter Elanor twelve days later. Prior to departing Middle-earth, he also wrote his own story ""The Lord of the Rings"" along with Bilbo's ""There and Back Again"" in the Red Book of Westmarch.
On September 22, TA 3021 (Third Age), at the age of 53, Frodo joined Bilbo, Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel aboard the White Ship at the Grey Havens. He was allowed passage across the sea to the Undying Lands, as he was a Ring-bearer, with the hope of healing the damage to his spirit that bearing the Ring had caused.[3]
Fourth Age
During the Fourth Age, Frodo spent his last days on Tol Eressëa in ""a period of reflection and peace"", attempting to understand his place in Arda, having been given the opportunity as he healed from the trauma afflicted upon him due to his quest during the War of the Ring.[3]
In the year FA 61, fellow Ring-bearer Samwise Gamgee, sailed to the Undying Lands, possibly reuniting with Frodo, assuming he was still alive.",

95,TA 2763,TA 2994,Male,White,,Balin,Dwarves,,,"Early life
Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself. Thráin was captured and lost.[1]
Quest of Erebor
Balin was part of the company assembled by Thorin Oakenshield in TA 2941 that journeyed to the Lonely Mountain with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf to defeat Smaug, and to retake the kingdom of Erebor. He was the second Dwarf to arrive at Bilbo's home, where, like his brother Dwalin, he played a viol as big as himself.[2] Following the meeting's conclusion and the company's initial departure to the Green Dragon Inn, Balin spotted Bilbo hurrying to reach them before they set out.[3]
Balin visits Bilbo in The Hobbit films
Balin, along with his companions, underwent the journey through the Trollshaws and Lone-lands to Rivendell, including the encounter with the trolls Tom, Bert, and William.[3] The company rested in Rivendell for some time, and after setting out to cross the Misty Mountains, were captured by Orcs on the High Pass, after taking refuge from a thunderstorm.[4] With Gandalf's help, the Dwarves escaped, and subsequently Balin was posted as a lookout when Bilbo returned, having been separated from the company during their flight. Due to Bilbo's usage of the One Ring, which he had discovered in the Orc tunnels, the Hobbit crept by Balin unnoticed, puzzling the Dwarf a great deal. Soon afterwards, the company was beset by Wargs, which forced them to climb a number of pine trees until their rescue by the Great Eagles.[5]
The Eagles took them to their eyrie, and then to the Carrock, from whence the company traveled to the Beorn's hall.[5] Gandalf decided to introduce the Dwarves by pairs so as not to overwhelm Beorn, and Balin and Dwalin were chosen to come first. Having been welcomed by the skin-changer and given rest and provisions, the company set out to cross the forest of Mirkwood.[6] Despite having been warned to the contrary, the Dwarves eventually left the path after running low on supplies, and were soon waylaid by great spiders, which intended to eat them. Bilbo used the Ring to escape notice, and returned to free them. Balin afterwards led the company in escaping from and fighting off the spiders, though the Dwarves were captured by Wood-elves, and taken to the hall of the Elvenking, Thranduil. It was here that Balin spoke for his companions, arguing for their release. Thranduil refused, and imprisoned the Dwarves, until Bilbo again rescued the company.[7]
The Dwarves came to Lake-town,[8] and then to the Lonely Mountain. After opening the Side-door to the mountain,[9] Balin was the only member of the company willing to go with Bilbo some way inside. The hobbit, after unintentionally disturbing the dragon Smaug, returned to the Dwarves, but Smaug left his lair and attempted to kill the Dwarves before turning to Lake-town, with the intent to destroy it.[10] The dragon was there slain by Bard, and the Dwarves took possession of the mountain.[11] Thorin and Balin, not long after, came upon the raven Roäc, who brought word of the dragon's demise.[12]
Balin fought in and survived the subsequent Battle of Five Armies, which was fought against Orcs led by Bolg, after tensions with the Lake-men and Wood-elves had run high, due to a disagreement about the division of Smaug's treasure.[13] He took up residence at the Lonely Mountain afterwards with the surviving members of the company.
Visiting Bilbo
Seven years after the Quest for Erebor, Balin accompanied Gandalf to visit Bilbo in the Shire in TA 2949, since the two had become good friends during their travels. He and Gandalf gave Bilbo the news of current happenings in Middle-earth.[14]
Sometime afterward in the coming years before his expedition in TA 2989, Balin would visit Bilbo at least one more time. During this visit to the Shire, Balin met Bilbo's newly adopted heir of Bag End, Frodo, and the young Hobbit would come to learn of some of Balin and his Uncle's travels to the lonely mountain.
Expedition into Moria
Balin at his death bed
In TA 2989,[14] Balin led an expedition in an attempt to reclaim the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria, hoping to re-establish Dwarven rule and to reclaim the last of the Seven Rings of the Dwarves.[15] Though his king did not give his consent, Balin and company went anyway. Among his numbers were fellow members of Thorin's company Óin and Ori. While in Moria, he discovered Durin's Axe and a Mithril helm (possibly the crown of Durin l) and claimed them as his own. After the discovery of these items Balin, being a descendant of the line of Durin, claimed rulership over the Dwarven realm, taking the title Lord of Moria (his colony being too small to be counted as a kingdom). Ultimately, the search for the ring, which conferred great wealth and a curse of greed on its owner, was in vain, as it had been taken from Thráin II by Sauron.
Death
After ruling as Moria's Lord for about five years, Balin was slain by Orcs on November 10 TA 2994,[14] after going to look upon the Mirromere alone. His body was recovered after a battle, and entombed in the Chamber of Mazarbul. The attempt to retake Moria ultimately failed afterward, as the rest of his kin were eventually trapped and killed.[16] Ironically, he died in the same place and the same way as his father had been slain 195 years before in TA 2799.[citation needed]
Legacy
Balin's tomb at the time of the Fellowship's arrival
Some twenty-five years later in TA 3019, the Fellowship of the Ring passed through Moria and discovered Balin's tomb, and the truth of what happened to his expedition, which had not previously been known, in the Book of Mazarbul. The knowledge of this brought much grief to Balin's cousin Gimli, who was a member of the fellowship.[16]",

He was the father of Morwen, and he was thus the grandfather of Túrin Turambar. He and his family lived peacefully in Dorthonion before the Dagor Bragollach. He survived the battle and lived as an outlaw with his uncle Barahir and other companions for nearly five years. They were eventually betrayed to Sauron by the unhappy Gorlim and killed at Tarn Aeluin.[1][2]",
97,FA 402,FA 460,Male,Possibly dark,,Barahir,Men,,Emeldir,"Earlier, Barahir had fought at the Dagor Bragollach, saving Finrod Felagund's life earning him and his house the friendship of the House of Finarfin. For this, he received the Ring of Barahir, which was then handed down the family line. After the Dagor Bragollach by FA 456,[1] Barahir lived with his faithful XII Bëorings on the highland of Dorthonion at Tarn Aeluin as outlaws defying the will of Morgoth, whose forces hunted him and his company like wild beasts.[5] The members of Barahir's XII Bëorings was his son Beren, his nephews Baragund the elder and Belegund the younger, Radhruin and Dairuin, Dagnir and Ragnor, Gildor and Gorlim the Unhappy, Arthad, and Urthel, and Hathaldir the Young. As for his wife Emeldir, she parted from Barahir when she became the leader of the women and children of Bëor's folk that fled Dorthonion. For her bravery in this, Barahir's wife was known as Emeldir the Man-hearted,
For five years, Barahir led his doomed band of outlaws until FA 460 when they were betrayed to Sauron by Gorlim, a lovesick member of Barahir's outlaw band and Barahir was killed at Tarn Aeluin, along with everyone in his company save for Beren his son, who was gone on an errand for them and thus luckily happened to not be there. Barahir's remains were buried in a cairn by his son at Tarn Aeluin, other than his hand which was chopped off by Gorgol, an Orc captain of Sauron. Beren later slew Gorgol and recovered the Ring of Barahir. Barahir's son then escaped Dorthonion after all and lived on to fulfil a great destiny.[6]
Legacy[]
Barahir's service to Finrod and House of Finarfin left behind a legacy of respect between the House of Bëor, later generations of Men, and Elves. This friendship led to the close association of the Elves and the Dúnedain of Númenor and Arnor and Gondor. His ring also became an heirloom of the Dúnedain of the North of Middle-earth.",

101,TA 2898,TA 2977,Male,Black (films),,Bard,Men,Dale,Unnamed wife,"Bard the Bowman
Bard was descended from Lord Girion of Dale, whose wife and child had escaped to Lake-town when Smaug ruined Dale and took the Lonely Mountain in TA 2770.
In TA 2941, when Smaug emerged from the Lonely Mountain and attacked Lake-town, Bard, as captain of a company of town archers, was encouraging the archers and urging the town Master to order them to fight to the last arrow. Bard himself fired many arrows with his great yew bow. He was down to his last arrow when a thrush came and perched over his shoulder. Because Bard was of the race of Dale, he was able to understand the thrush's words. The bird told him of the weak spot in Smaug's armor that Bilbo Baggins had discovered. Bard fired his Black Arrow and struck the hollow by Smaug's left breast and the dragon fell from the sky, landing on Lake-town and destroying it.[2]
Bard escaped into the lake and swam ashore. The people wanted him to be their King, but he said he would continue to serve the Master of Lake-town for the time being. Bard took charge of organizing shelter and aid for the refugees and sent messages to the Elvenking of Mirkwood asking for help. Then, Bard and the Elvenking led their forces to the Lonely Mountain, seeking a share of the treasure.[3]
When they arrived at the Lonely Mountain, they were surprised to find Thorin II and his company of Dwarves still alive. Bard sought reparations from Thorin on the grounds that it was he who had slain Smaug, that part of the Dragon’s treasure had once belonged to Dale, and that the people of Lake-town were suffering and needed aid. Thorin said that the destruction of Lake-town was not his responsibility and he refused to parley with armies camped outside the mountain. Bard sent a messenger several hours later asking for one-twelfth of the treasure, but again Thorin refused.[3]
Bilbo Baggins thought that Bard's claims were reasonable, so one night he went secretly to the camp of the Lake-men and Elves. The Hobbit had found the Arkenstone - the treasure that Thorin most desired - and he offered it to Bard and Thranduil to use to negotiate. He also told them that an army of 500 Dwarves led by Dáin Ironfoot was coming from the Iron Hills.[4]
The next day, Bard asked Thorin for a portion of the treasure in exchange for the Arkenstone. Thorin was enraged, but he reluctantly agreed to give up Bilbo's one-fourteenth share. Dáin's army arrived the next day, and Bard tried to prevent them from entering the Lonely Mountain until the exchange for the Arkenstone had been made. A battle seemed imminent, but then Gandalf told them that an army of goblins and Wargs were approaching. Bard, Thranduil, and Dáin took council together and they joined forces to fight their common enemy in the Battle of Five Armies. During the battle, Thorin emerged from the mountain and rallied Dwarves, Elves, and Men to the attack, but he was mortally wounded. Bard laid the Arkenstone upon Thorin's breast when he was buried under the mountain, and Dáin agreed to pay the one-fourteenth share of the treasure as promised. Bard gave the emeralds of Girion to Thranduil in gratitude for his assistance. Bard also contributed gold for the rebuilding of Lake-town, and although the Master of Lake-town absconded with much of it, Lake-town was rebuilt and its people became prosperous.[5]
Bard the Bowman as portrayed by Luke Evans in The Hobbit films
Bard went to his ancestral home of Dale at the foot of the Lonely Mountain. He rebuilt the ruined town and in TA 2944, he became King of Dale. Bard maintained good relations with the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain and trade flowed freely up and down the River Running. People came to settle in Dale from miles around and the land that had been withered by Smaug became bountiful once more.[1]

Beorn kept many animals at his residence, such as horses, dogs, and sheep. His animals were all extremely intelligent; his dogs, for instance, could walk on their hind legs while carrying things with their forelegs, set the table, and able to speak. Beorn's horses could also understand what their master said. Beorn was also capable of speaking in the tongue of beasts, as he could communicate with bears. When he spoke to his dogs, his words sounded like ""barks twisted into some form of speech"".[1]
Quest of Erebor[]
In the year TA 2941, Beorn granted shelter to Thorin and Company, which included Gandalf and the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. Beorn, though not over fond of Dwarves, provided the company with food, supplies, and guidance after being humored by Gandalf's telling of the company's story. The company then left Beorn to travel through Mirkwood, though the Beorning warned them not to drink from the Enchanted stream within the forest.[1]

Initially both realms were under attack and neither could help the other; however, Beregond was a great warrior and sea captain. The Corsairs who attacked Gondor were defeated by him before the coming of spring. Beregond then went north to Rohan to relieve the besieged Rohirrim. Together the forces of Beregond and Fréaláf Hildeson, the King of Rohan, defeated the Corsairs, Easterlings and Dunlendings.[2]
Beregond's father, Beren died in TA 2763 and Beregond succeeded him as the twentieth Ruling Steward.
In the thirtieth year of Beregond's stewardship in TA 2793, Middle-earth saw the beginning of the six year War of the Dwarves and Orcs that culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. Following that defeat many Orcs sought to take refuge in the safety of the White Mountains. The Men of Gondor led by Beregond slew many Orcs that attempted to establish themselves in the mountains, and prevented the Orcs from establishing large scale settlements and strongholds.[2]
Beregond died in TA 2811 at the age of 111 years old and was succeeded by his son Belecthor II.[2]",

He never left Minas Tirith during his service in the guard before the War of the Ring. He was also a great admirer of Faramir, son of Denethor II, and perhaps one of his friends as well.
When Peregrin Took came to the city in March 3019, Beregond and his son Bergil served as his guides in Minas Tirith.
During the Siege of Gondor, Beregond received news from Pippin that Denethor intended to kill both himself and the seemingly-dead Faramir. Leaving his post, he fought the door guards of the place where Denethor had taken Faramir in order to reach him, until the arrival of Gandalf and Pippin, whereupon Faramir was saved. After protecting Faramir, he carried him to the Houses of Healing and stood guard over him until he awoke.

Beregond traveled with Aragorn's army to the Black Gate of Mordor to challenge the forces of Sauron. They served under Prince Imrahil, and during the Battle of the Black Gate Beregond was nearly killed by a Troll.
After the War of the Ring, Beregond was brought before the newly crowned King Elessar to answer for the abandonment of his post, as well as the murders of those who stood in his way as he raced to rescue Faramir. Recognizing that what he did was out of love for his lord, he did not impose the death penalty upon him; the newly-crowned king's largesse allowed for Beregond to simply be banished from Minas Tirith but this was under old Gondor law which left the punishment non and void but he was encouraged to live in Ithilien to serve Faramir, for whom he had broken the laws to rescue. He was also promoted to the rank of Captain of the White Company.[1][2][3][4][5]",

Berelach served in the Fleet of Gondor, and for several years he was stationed at Harlond. He sometimes visited his father at Pen-arduin to ease his grief and loneliness, often accompanied by Saelon.[2]
During the year 217 of the Fourth Age, his visits became short and not very often, as he had been given a high command, and thus spent many of his days at sea. But even when he was on land, his duty often kept him within Pelargir.[1]
When Berelach had last visited his father before leaving again in April of the year 220, he told him of a recent incident in which a few Shipmen and a small vessel of the King's ships had disappeared. Berelach makes the assumption that the shipmen must have left without leave on some tasks of their own and drowned. Berelach reasoned that the Shipmen were unskilled and deserved their fate, serving as evidence that the Ships had too few skilled sailers and that fish were more profitable.[2]
Later in the month of June, Borlas quoted Berelach's tale to Saelon, only for Saelon to contradict Berelach by saying that the Shipmen were skilled sons of fishermen and that there had been no storms along the coast for a long time.[2]

Beren was one of the Edain (Men), the son of Barahir and Emeldir the man-hearted. He was of the noble House of Bëor of Dorthonion and was the most accomplished hero and adventurer of the First Age. The battle of the Dagor Bragollach befell during his youth, bringing about the ruin of his people. The young Beren lived with his father and eleven loyal followers in the highlands of Dorthonion, and the thirteen of them performed many acts of bravery, to the great frustration of Morgoth, the Dark Lord of Angband.
The encounter of Beren and Lúthien by Marinela Mexi
After the ruin of the XII Bëorings of Dorthonion and the death of his father, Beren hunted the Orcs responsible, killing Gorgol and reclaiming the hand of his father and Ring of Barahir. After this he lived alone off the land in Dorthonion; he came to know the many birds and beasts that lived there, and they helped him when he had need. During this time, he hunted nothing and ate no meat and killed only the creatures of Morgoth that roamed the country. He learned not to fear death, only captivity and bondage; however, things began to grow more difficult for him, for Morgoth put an even greater price on his head and he was forced from the land of his birth by Sauron and Draugluin. He passed through the forests of Nan Dungortheb, then into Doriath, breaching the Girdle of Melian as prophesied, where he saw and fell in love with Lúthien, princess of the Sindar and daughter of Thingol and Melian.[6]

Quest for the Silmaril[]
Beren before Lúthien in Menegroth, by Donato Giancola
""A moment of fleeting peace"" By Sepide Donne
Thingol haughtily refused to give Lúthien's hand in marriage. He said that he would allow the marriage only if Beren brought back a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth. The task was intended to be impossible, but Beren and Lúthien, with the aid of Finrod of Nargothrond and Huan the Great Hound, braved many perils (even besting Sauron, then Morgoth's most powerful lieutenant) and took a Silmaril. However, as they escaped from Angband, the great wolf Carcharoth, whom Morgoth had personally bred, awoke. Beren held out the Silmaril, hoping that its radiance would avert the beast, but he was mistaken. Carcharoth bit off his hand, swallowed it and the Silmaril (thus Beren was called Erchamion, One-hand), and proceeded to run rampant through Doriath. Lúthien and the unconscious Beren were rescued by the Eagles of Manwë. When he presented himself to Thingol, he proclaimed to the Elven king that he even now had a Silmaril in his hand. When Thingol demanded that Beren present the jewel, he held forth the stump of his hand, and he was then given the name Camlost, Empty-handed. He and Lúthien then told Thingol of their quest. Thingol was utterly astonished by Beren's tale, and though Beren bore no Silmaril upon him, he gave his permission for Beren and Lúthien to wed. For the sheer improbability of Beren's success had demonstrated to Thingol that Beren was no mere Man, for he and Lúthien had achieved what all the hosts of the Elves and Edain had never come even close to accomplishing. Beren participated in the hunting of Carcharoth, where the beast was slain and the Silmaril recovered; the quest was accomplished, but in the process Beren was mortally wounded.[6]
Second life[]
Lúthien's love for Beren was so strong that, upon hearing of his death, she lay down and died. Her soul went to the Halls of Mandos, where she managed to charm Mandos into granting her a wish. Both she and Beren were miraculously restored to life, but both of them would live as mortals and die the death of Men, and go beyond the walls of Arda to a place unknown. Thus Beren and Lúthien lived again, and dwelt on Tol Galen in the middle of the river Adurant in Ossiriand. There they stayed apart from other mortals; Beren was involved with the events of the First Age only one further time, when he waylaid a group of Dwarves who had sacked Menegroth and stolen the Nauglamír (and the Silmaril with it).[6]
Beren being revived by Lúthien - by Justin Gerard
Lúthien bore Beren a son, named Dior, Thingol's heir, considered to be one of the fairest beings to ever live, for in him flowed the blood of Men, of Elves, and of the Ainur. Through his descendants, the blood of Beren and of Lúthien was preserved among the Eldar and the Edain.[6]
Legacy[]
Beren's deeds inspired all the peoples opposing Morgoth to unite themselves into a greater force to vanquish his power, resulting in the valiant but doomed Union of Maedhros.[7] His romance and love for Lúthien Tinúviel and what he was willing to do to ensure it helped foster greater respect for men amongst the Elves.
The union of Beren and Lúthien was the first between a mortal Man and an Elven maid. His granddaughter Elwing married Earendil, son of Tuor and Idril, thus becoming the great-grandfather of Elrond and Elros, the first being one of the most influential figures of the Second and Third Age and the second the first King of Númenor. Her lineage passed down to the royal House of Elros of Númenor, and then to the House of Elendil, and on to the Kings of the Reunited Kingdom and beyond. Beren's romance with Lúthien is one of the great stories of the Elder Days, and it is mirrored by the later romance between their descendants Aragorn and Arwen Evenstar. According to legend, his line would never be broken as long as the world lasted.

He guided Peregrin Took throughout the city when he and Gandalf arrived, and they became very good friends in the process. Before the attack began, Bergil and Pippin witnessed the arrival of reinforcements from other parts of Gondor to defend the city. During the Siege of Minas Tirith, Bergil helped the healers of the city as an errand runner and so eventually contributed to the healing of Faramir, the Steward's son and later Prince of Ithilien.
Bergil who, running errands for the healers of Minas Tirith, told Gandalf where Pippin and the injured Meriadoc Brandybuck were; Merry, suffering from the Black Breath, had gotten lost during the battle on the Fields of Pelennor. He was also the one who brought the Athelas leaves to Aragorn; at that time, he showed his love for Faramir by bursting into tears. Bergil also kept Merry company while the Captains of the West led their men off to the Black Gate and then escorted him back to the Houses of Healing.[1]
Of Bergil's destiny the novel or its appendices tell nothing. It is probable that he went with his father into Ithilien after the War of the Ring was over. His younger brother Borlas was central to ""The New Shadow"", the soon-abandoned draft for a The Lord of the Rings sequel.[2]",

Childhood
Bilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire-reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), in the year 2890 of the Third Age. He was the only son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took.
In Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious Hobbit-hole for Belladonna, which they named Bag End. The family moved to their new home, where Bilbo would spend much of his life.
As a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside world. The Istar wizard, Gandalf, took interest in this unusual quality in Bilbo during his visits to the Shire. Bilbo would later remember Gandalf's fireworks in the dwelling of his mother's family at Great Smials. Bilbo apparently practiced his rock-throwing skills in his youth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever he bent down to pick up a rock.
When Bilbo's father and mother died in TA 2926 and TA 2934 respectively, Bilbo became his own master and spent the next seven years living alone in Bag End. During this time, Bilbo grew fond of his life as a wealthy bachelor and acquired a reputation for respectability that the neighbors admired.

Quest of Erebor
Main article: Quest of Erebor

An Unexpected Journey
In the year TA 2941, Bilbo, at the age of 50, was visited by Gandalf, whom he had not seen for quite some time, outside his home at Bag End. Gandalf invited Bilbo on an unspecified adventure, which was flatly refused by the hobbit, who bade the wizard a ""Good morning"", and went inside.
Undeterred, Gandalf continued in his plan, sending thirteen Dwarves, led by Thorin II, to Bag End the very day. These Dwarves, needing an additional member for their company, initially came by pairs, and lastly with Gandalf, who had himself selected Bilbo as the best person for the Dwarves' job. The Dwarves explained to Bilbo their background and purpose; that they were among the Dwarves of Erebor who had been forced from Erebor when the dragon Smaug attacked and taken up residence there. They now had determined to reclaim the mountain and needed a ""burglar"" to help them in situations requiring stealth. Bilbo reluctantly agreed to go, and the next morning they set off from the Green Dragon Inn.[1]
Thorin and company traveled through the Lone-lands along high hills and beside castles. After approximately one month since their outset, Gandalf disappeared. Óin and Glóin failed to make a fire during a rainy night, and Balin spotted a fire in the distance, which was rare in those regions, and sent Bilbo to investigate. At the fire were three Stone-trolls, Tom, Bert, and William. Bilbo attempted to snatch something from the trolls to bring back to the Dwarves, to show that he was a first-class burglar. However, he was caught by William, but he escaped and was helpless to prevent all the Dwarves from being captured when they came looking for him. Fortunately for the Dwarves, Gandalf returned and saved them all by imitating the trolls' voices and tricking the trolls into arguing with one another until daybreak, which turned them all to stone.
Bilbo as portrayed by Martin Freeman
After rescuing the party, the wizard led Bilbo and the party to the Trolls' lair, which the trolls had used to hide their treasure and shield themselves from the sun during the daylight hours. In the cave, a number of weapons were found, Glamdring (Beater) and Orcrist (Biter) among them. Bilbo took an Elvish dagger from the trolls' collection, no longer than a small knife in size, which he would later name Sting. He kept it with him for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.[2]
In June the company came to Rivendell. During their visit, Bilbo met Lord Elrond, and became enchanted with the Elves. On midsummer eve Elrond inspected the swords of Thorin and Gandalf and looked at Thrór's Map, which Gandalf had previously given to Thorin at the behest of Thorin's father Thráin II. Elrond explained that the swords were forged in Gondolin and were named Orcrist and Glamdring. When inspecting the map Elrond found Moon-letters that spoke of the Side-door of Erebor, which read: Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.[3]
Discovery of the One Ring
Bilbo and his companions then traveled from Rivendell and made their way to the High Pass of the Misty Mountains, where they witnessed the distant thunder-battle of giants. It was here the company, after taking shelter in what they took to be a simple cave, were captured by Orcs and taken to Goblin-town. With Gandalf's help, they escaped from the Great Goblin and his servants. Dori, however, who was carrying Bilbo, was grabbed from behind by an orc, and in the ensuing struggle Bilbo lost consciousness and was inadvertently left by his companions.[4]
Bilbo finds The One Ring
Coming to and finding himself alone, Bilbo crawled his way through the pitch-black tunnel, using his hobbit nose to gain a sense of direction. He eventually stumbled upon a small Ring, but thought nothing of it, and put it in his back pocket. Although he did not know it, this lost trinket was the One Ring, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron thousands of years ago. Bilbo soon encountered Gollum, who had been in possession of the Ring for over five hundred years. The two challenged each other to a Riddle-game with the condition that Gollum would show the way out if Bilbo won. However, Gollum was not satisfied with Bilbo's final riddle, and while mourning his loss, found that his Ring was gone. Gollum then realized the answer to Bilbo's riddle, ""What have I got in my pocket?"" and paddled back on his boat towards Bilbo, who he then accused of stealing his precious, but Bilbo had vanished.[5]
Gollum and Bilbo in Gollum's cave, by Michael Herring, as cover art for Ballantine Books' The Hobbit (1983)
Gollum, thinking Bilbo had known the way out and was leaving, headed to the exit and was followed by Bilbo. Bilbo was soon reunited with his companions. Bilbo and the travelers had stopped for the night when orcs and a pack of Wargs found them near a patch of pine trees. The Dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf climbed up the trees to escape, but the orcs were not going to leave without killing them. They started to burn the trees down. The chief wolf was ordering the other wargs around when Gandalf picked up a pinecone, and with his magic set it ablaze in a green fire. He threw it down hitting the chieftain. It rolled around on the ground burning while Gandalf threw more and more pinecones down. The goblins and wargs fled and the group was rescued by the Great Eagles. When one of the eagles grabbed Dori, Bilbo had to jump and grab Dori's legs before he was forgotten. This prompted Bilbo to groan ""My arms! My poor arms,"" and Dori to cry, ""My legs! My poor legs!"" The eagles eventually took them to the Great Shelf where they rested and continued their journey.[6]
Into Wilderland
The group traveled to Beorn's hall where they rested, after being gruffly taken in by Beorn and his animal servants. Beorn learned their story and gave a large number of provisions to help their quest. Beorn also lent several ponies to be used until the group reached Mirkwood. However, Beorn did not fully trust the Dwarves, so Bilbo saw Beorn giving careful watch to see that his ponies were unharmed. When the company arrived at the Forest Gate the ponies were let go (to several of the Dwarves discontent) and Gandalf left the group as well, warning them, ""Do not stray off the path.""[7]
Bilbo reaches the canopy of Mirkwood in The Hobbit films
The Company began to follow the Elf-path through the treacherous forest. Eventually the provisions ran low and the Company was forced to send Bilbo up a tree to see where the forest ended. Bilbo climbed up a tree, where a rewarding breeze of cool air and butterflies met him. Bilbo only saw more forest, so when he reluctantly climbed back down, he did not see that the forest ended. He reported his findings to the Dwarves, where they met the news with ill comfort, angry that they were fatter than Bilbo and so could not climb the trees to feel cool air or see the butterflies. Eventually the last provisions were eaten. The Company then came upon the Enchanted stream, of which they had been warned not to drink by Beorn. Bilbo saw a boat on the other side, leading the Dwarves to retrieve it. A deer came out of nowhere when all the Dwarves were on the other side. A Dwarf shot it where it died, on the other side. The Dwarves hoped for venison for dinner, when Bilbo realized that Bombur was drowning. The Dwarves fished him out to find he had been put to sleep by the stream's magic, but the boat was knocked away, ending the hope for venison.
While wandering down the path, the Dwarves saw lights in the forest. Deciding that they would rather leave the path than starve to death they headed after the lights. As soon as they got to the lights, they went out and one of their party fell asleep. This happened twice. On the third time all of them fell asleep.
When Bilbo awoke in the night, he was alone. He cursed the Dwarves for leaving the path and discovered that great spiders had captured his companions. Bilbo was forced to find his lost companions and cut through the cocoons the spiders had formed around his companions. He distracted the spiders by improvising several insulting songs to irritate them, and succeeded when the creatures left their domain to find the intruder and eat him. Bilbo killed a few by throwing stones at them and by stabbing them with Sting. The spiders never found him, since during this time Bilbo made use of the Ring to remain invisible. After freeing the Dwarves, he led them into a charge against the spiders, where the company killed dozens of the arachnids.[8]
After traveling through Mirkwood the Dwarves were taken prisoner by Wood-elves, who believed that the company had ""assaulted"" the Elves while they were partying (the bright lights the company had seen in the forest). Bilbo avoided being caught by using the ring to stay invisible, and followed them into the Halls of Thranduil, the Elven-king, where they were held captive. Eventually Bilbo was able to rescue the Dwarves by stealing the chief of the guard's keys, and found a way for the company to escape the Woodland Realm by stowing away in a number of empty barrels, which periodically were taken by the Elves down the Forest River to Lake-town for trading purposes. The plan worked, and soon they all arrived at Lake-town, which they found to be a small town occupied by Men that Smaug would sometimes attack, though he had not been seen in many years.[9]
Bilbo hiding from Smaug, invisible, by Raoul Vitale
The captain of the guard in Lake-town took Bilbo and the Dwarves to the Great House to present the company to the Master and his councilors, and though the Master initially thought to imprison them in order to keep good relations with the wood-elves, he decided against it when the populace proved to be strongly in support of Thorin's company. Thus, Bilbo and the Dwarves spent several weeks in Lake-town as guests of honor, though Bilbo eventually caught a cold.[10]
The Lonely Mountain
Before long Thorin's company departed Lake-town, and crossing the river, followed Thrór's Map to the location of the Side-door before the end of Durin's Day. Upon discovering the keyhole, the door was opened and Bilbo was sent in alone in order to scout ahead and perhaps to steal some treasure from Smaug.[11] When he arrived in the treasure chamber, however, Smaug was awake and sensed his presence, and so Bilbo put on the ring to avoid being seen.
Bilbo conversing with Smaug in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
Smaug, though unable to see the hobbit, tried to figure out who or what the intruder was, but Bilbo refused to tell the dragon his true identity, answering Smaug's questions only in riddles. While invisible, Bilbo noticed that Smaug had a bare spot on his jewel-encrusted underbelly. Finally, Bilbo removed the ring and Smaug saw that he had stolen a cup, causing him to go into a terrible rage. After Bilbo made it out of Smaug's lair safely, he convinced Thorin and the other Dwarves to enter the side-door and close it behind them, which saved their lives when Smaug left the mountain, and flying to the side-door, scorched the surrounding area. Foiled, the dragon flew off to Lake-town with the intent to destroy it once and for all.[12] Bilbo afterwards relayed to the Dwarves what he had learned, but a thrush, hearing the information, flew to Lake-town and told Bard, a descendant of the Men of Dale, of Smaug's weakness. On Smaug's arrival, Bard shot the Black Arrow at the bare spot, killing Smaug and sending him to rot at the bottom of the lake, but destroying most of Lake-town.[13]

Bilbo giving the Arkenstone to Thranduil in the films
In the meantime, Thorin and company had reclaimed the Lonely Mountain, though Bilbo, having found the Arkenstone that Thorin greatly desired, kept it secret from the Dwarf.[14] They were informed by Roäc, an old raven of the mountain, of Smaug's death in Lake-town, but quickly the Dwarves' mirth was dampened by the news that the surviving Men of Lake-town and the Elven-king's army were marching to the mountain to reclaim their wealth. Thorin, suspicious of the armies, refused to make any deal, with them at their arrival, and barricaded the mountain, thus beginning a siege.[15] Bilbo, hoping to avoid conflict, took the Arkenstone to Bard and Thranduil, in order for them to barter their share of the treasure with. Despite Bard and the Elvenking's offers for the hobbit to stay with them for the time being, Bilbo decided to return to the mountain. To his surprise on leaving to return to Thorin's company, he found that Gandalf had returned, and found the wizard supported his decision. Bilbo then slipped back to the mountain, unnoticed by the Dwarves.[16]
Bilbo with dying Thorin, by Darrell Sweet
Thorin, on soon afterwards discovering Bilbo's perceived treachery, was furious and banished the hobbit from the mountain. Bilbo stayed with Gandalf and Bard for a short time, until Dwarves from the Iron Hills, led by Dáin Ironfoot, arrived to aid Thorin's cause. However, shortly following this, a great army of goblins, led by Bolg, attacked, forcing the Dwarves, Elves, and Men to fight together to both defend the mountain and survive. This became known as the Battle of Five Armies, and though the goblins were defeated, Thorin and his nephews Fíli and Kíli were mortally wounded. Bilbo only witnessed part of the battle, as he was rendered unconscious early on, and wearing the ring, lay undiscovered until he came to following the battle's conclusion.[17] Beorn, chieftain of the Beornings, who had joined the fight, slew Bolg, scattered his bodyguard, and carried Thorin to safety. Bilbo, making his way to the tents of the wounded, found Thorin lying on a bed, in his last minutes of life. Thorin praised Bilbo and apologized to him for cursing him earlier, and thereafter passed away.
After Thorin's funeral, the new king Dáin II offered him his one-fourteenth share of the treasure, but Bilbo declined, receiving only two small chests, one with gold, and the other laden with silver. Bilbo traveled back with the wood-elf host that participated in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo traveled with the wood-elves down to Mirkwood, and then went to Beorn's house with Gandalf.[18] Then Bilbo set out with Gandalf to where Bert, Tom, and William had turned to stone. They dug up some of the buried treasure the Dwarves had buried earlier, most of which Bilbo offered to Gandalf to use to aid the peoples of Middle-earth. When they at last came to the borders of the Shire, the two parted, with Gandalf going his own way.
Return to the Shire
Bilbo finds his belongings being auctioned off.
Bilbo eventually made it back to Hobbiton, where he found an auction taking place at which his relatives, the Sackville-Bagginses, believing him dead, were selling most of his possessions to the other hobbits. The Sackville-Bagginses were vexed to see Bilbo alive, since they wanted to live in Bag End themselves. Bilbo had to buy back his sold possessions in order to avoid quarreling with the purchasers. After some years, Balin and Gandalf visited him, where they reported the current news of Middle-earth.[19]
Later years
Returning to Shire-life
Although Bilbo returned safely to Bag End with his reward and lived in relative comfort, Bilbo’s life was not quite the same as it had once been. His sudden return after having been thought dead lost him some of the neighbors’ respect and he was later thought of as an oddity, and there were many talks and false rumors circulated about his affairs and doings. The worst of these problems came from the Sackville-Bagginses, who were angry that they were not able to possess Bag End when he was thought to be dead. This jealousy and anger increased when Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo (a Brandybuck on his mother's side) as his heir presumptive. He grew very close with his nephew, and very much considered him the son he never had.
Bilbo ignored these things said about him and avoided the Sackville-Bagginses as much as he could, even using the Ring once to hide from them. Bilbo was very generous with his money and most people were willing to forgive him for his oddities. He had many friends especially amongst the Gamgees whom he consulted frequently on landscaping and on the growing of vegetables. His good friend Hamfast Gamgee even allowed him to tutor his son Samwise Gamgee. Bilbo taught him to read and write, and at some point taught him various bits of poetry and told him tales of the elder days. Yet, he slowly began to become weary of his settled and sheltered life at Bag End.
Another adventure
Bilbo at the time of his 111th birthday party, in The Lord of the Rings films
Bilbo was the bearer of the One Ring for six decades, ignorant of its significance. However, by TA 3001, the Ring had begun to affect him. He did not appear to have aged at all, although he felt older and thin inside. He decided that he wanted to partake in one last adventure before he found a place to settle down and finish his account of the Quest for the Lonely Mountain.
On September 22, a Farewell Birthday Party was held in his honor, with even Gandalf returning for a visit. During the fesitivties, he is forced to hide from the Sackville-Bagginses once more with Frodo in tow, and secretly assures himself that Frodo will alright without him. Nearing the end of his party, he announced his intention to leave the Shire, to the shock of his family and friends, especially Frodo. Immediately afterward, he put on his Ring and disappeared, as a joke on his neighbors. He returned to his house where he was confronted by his friend Gandalf, who tried to persuade him to leave the Ring for Frodo. Bilbo initially agreed, but then became hostile and accused Gandalf of trying to steal the ring for his own benefit, which he referred to as his ""precious.""
""Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so! But you won't get it. I won't give my Precious away, I tell you.""
—Bilbo Baggins[20]
Bilbo gives up the Ring before leaving Bag End
Horrified by Bilbo's outburst, Gandalf stood to his full height and ordered Bilbo to leave it behind. Immediately Bilbo returned to his senses, apologizing and admitting that the Ring had been troubling him lately. Gandalf then asks Bilbo to trust his old friend as he had all those years ago, and let the ring go. After a moment of inner struggle, Bilbo finally dropped the ring to the ground, becoming the first Ring-bearer to give up the ring of his own will. Bilbo and Gandalf bade each other goodbye, and Bilbo left the Shire for his journey.

On the same day, Bilbo left the One Ring and his home of Bag End in the possession of his relative, Frodo Baggins, who was eager to be his own master despite the loss of Bilbo, for he was not yet ready to leave the Shire. After his departure, Bilbo wandered to Rivendell and then, after a rest, accompanied some Dwarves to Dale and the Lonely Mountain, before returning to Rivendell.
Life in Rivendell
Between TA 3003 and TA 3018, Bilbo worked on the written account of his adventures, in a book that would later be known as the Red Book of Westmarch. He also studied the Elvish language and compiled a three-volume history of the Elder Days, which he called Translations from the Elvish. He composed a poem for Aragorn as well as a much longer poem about Eärendil during his stay at Rivendell.[21]
In October 3018, Frodo arrived at Rivendell. Bilbo learned that his nephew was on a quest to destroy the One Ring and offered to take the Ring to Mordor himself at the Council of Elrond. His offer was politely declined due to his age, so Bilbo gave Frodo the sword Sting and for protection his Mithril Coat. However, he remained in Rivendell while Frodo traveled south. After Frodo returned, Bilbo had noticeably aged, partially freed from the Ring's effects, although he continued to desire it.
Leaving Middle-earth

Since Bilbo had been a ring-bearer, he was allowed to accompany Frodo to the Undying Lands. On September 22, 3021, Bilbo turned 131 and became the oldest hobbit ever to have lived. On September 29, he, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, and Frodo boarded a ship docked at the Grey Havens and sailed away from Middle-earth, with Biblo exclaiming he was excited for yet another adventure. His fate afterward is not known but as he too was a mortal being, he most likely died in the light of the Blessed Realm of Valinor.[22]",

After throwing down the chieftain with his spear, Théoden ""spurred to the standard"" of the ""black serpent upon scarlet"" and hewed the staff and the bearer of the standard with his sword, causing the ""black serpent upon scarlet"" to founder as the other Haradrim ""fled far away"".[1][2]

These spears were to each consist of ""a thrice-forged head"" with a shaft cunningly lined with gold. While the spears were indeed forged, the Dwarves never delivered them and Bladorthin never payed for them. As a consequence, the spears remained within Erebor.[1]
In the year 2941 during the Quest of Erebor long after Bladorthin had passed away, Thorin and Balin pondered on whether or not Bladorthin's order was still intact,[1] possibly implying that Bladorthin's realm was close in proximity to the Lonely Mountain.[citation needed]",

Fredegar could have gone with Frodo and his companions into the Old Forest, but was terrified of the stories about it. Though Merry tried to persuade him that the Old Forest would be nothing compared to meeting the Black Riders, Fatty was adamant, so the other Hobbits went into the forest with only the knowledge of Merry to aid them.

Journey to the Lonely Mountain[]
Bombur was the twelfth Dwarf arriving at Bag End to attend the meeting arranged by Gandalf, where the quest to reclaim Erebor began. Because he was commonly considered to count for two Dwarves due to his girth, he was the last to arrive at Beorn's house and the last to cross the Enchanted stream in Mirkwood. Bombur tumbled with Bifur and Bofur onto Thorin when they first entered Bag End. He chose to stay and guard the camp and supplies while the others moved up the Lonely Mountain, because he trusted neither mountain paths nor ropes to stay intact under his weight. However, he was later forced to use the ropes to escape the rampaging dragon Smaug before he could be slain.
Bombur was often asleep during the Quest of Erebor. When he was violently knocked into the Enchanted stream by an aggressive stag, he fell under a spell which caused him to sleep for several days, burdening the others with his weight as they traveled. Later Bombur awoke up, but different. Bombur had forgotten their previous adventures during their journey, only remembering the feast in Bilbo's home. When his barrel was opened after the escape from the Elvenking's Halls, he was found to be asleep. Once they arrived at the Lonely Mountain, he was assigned a midnight watch and was asleep when Bilbo discovered the Side-door. After the death of Smaug, Bilbo promised to keep watch to allow Bombur to rest. He then snuck the Arkenstone out of the mountain and delivered it to the Elvenking and Bard the Bowman.
He fought and survived along with most of the company at the Battle of Five Armies. After the defeat of Smaug, Bombur received his share of the treasure and remained at the Lonely Mountain until the end of his days.
Later years[]
In The Lord of the Rings, many years later while in Rivendell, Frodo Baggins learned from Glóin that Bombur had grown so fat it that it now took several Dwarves simply to lift him from his couch to the dinner table. It is unknown if Bombur fought in the Battle of Dale during the War of the Ring.",

Boromir was born in the year TA 2978. He was the eldest child of Denethor II, the last Ruling Steward of Gondor and his wife Find hills, and was the heir to the Stewardship. When Boromir was only ten years old, his mother died. Consequently, his father became grim and came to prefer Boromir over his brother, Faramir. Despite this fact, Boromir looked after his younger brother and they became very close. Boromir devoted himself to leading his people and fought in the battle for the eastern part of Osgiliath in TA 3018. He, his brother, and two others were the only survivors of the unit that held the bridge until its destruction; they had to swim the River Anduin to reach safety.
War of the Ring[]
""Why should we not think that the Great Ring has come into our hands to serve us in the very hour of need? Wielding it the Free Lords of the Free may surely defeat the Enemy.""
—The Fellowship of the Ring, ""The Council of Elrond""     Boromir as depicted by Donato Giancola
Following the battle, Boromir set out from Minas Tirith to Rivendell to decipher a riddle he had received (and his brother three times) in a dream:[2]
Seek for the Sword that was broken,
In Imladris it dwells,
There shall be counsels taken,
Stronger than Morgul-spells.
There shall be shown a token,
That Doom is near at hand,
For Isildur's Bane shall waken,
And the Halfling forth shall stand.
Boromir departing Minas Tirith for Rivendell, by C.K. Göksoy
Boromir lost his horse in Tharbad and travelled the rest of the way on foot. The journey took 110 days.[2] He arrived at the beginning of the Council of Elrond where he described how Gondor was defending itself from Mordor and tried to convince them to give the One Ring to Gondor, where he felt it would be kept safe. But the council did not agree that the One Ring should go to Gondor, deciding that the only safe course was to destroy it.[2]
Boromir joined the Fellowship of the Ring and was warned by Elrond not to blow the Great Horn until they were close to Gondor and in dire need.[2] On the voyage south Boromir advocated taking the Gap of Rohan, but was overruled as this lay too close to Isengard. He proved his worth as a capable warrior in Moria and assisted Aragorn in fighting off a large number of Orcs. After the loss of Gandalf and the Fellowship's departure from Moria, Boromir expressed opposition to Aragorn's decision to continue to Lothlórien, arguing that to go south was better. He believed the stories told in Gondor that Galadriel's magic would harm them. He eventually agreed to go after Aragorn assured him the Elves would help them. In Lothlórien, Boromir was disturbed by what he felt was Galadriel's testing of his mind, and he was suspicious of her motives.[3] Before leaving Lothlórien he was given the gift of an Elven-cloak and a golden belt.[4]
Boromir disliked the idea of destroying the One Ring, as he believed that it could be used to defeat Sauron once and for all, to save Gondor, and return it to its former glory; he tried to convince Frodo to give him the Ring. When Frodo refused, Boromir tried to take it by force but the hobbit put it on and fled.
After Boromir realized his actions were caused by the corruption of the One Ring, he repented, and upon returning to camp he was confronted by Aragorn about Frodo. Boromir told Aragorn that he had seen Frodo an hour ago where he had tried to convince Frodo to bring the One Ring to Minas Tirith. They then had an argument and Frodo walked off. After the argument, Boromir went for a walk until eventually returning to the camp. The Fellowship, especially Aragorn, believed that there was more to the confrontation than Boromir was telling them, but Aragorn did not press the issue. Upon hearing of Frodo's predicament, the rest of the Fellowship, particularly the Hobbits, scattered in an ill-conceived attempt to find him. Aragorn ordered Boromir to follow and look after Merry and Pippin while he took off after Sam.[5]

During the search, Merry and Pippin ran into a group of Uruk-hai, who tried to capture them. Boromir came to their aid and drove the Orcs off, but more Orcs came and Boromir was mortally wounded by many arrows. Aragorn found him dying under a tree, with Merry and Pippin gone. There Boromir confessed that he had attempted to take the ring from Frodo and expressed his remorse. Aragorn stayed with Boromir until he died from his wounds.[6]

""Farewell, Aragorn! Go to Minas Tirith and save my people! I have failed.""

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli laid his body inside one of the boats of Lórien, and sent him down the Falls of Rauros. Afterwards, they sang the Song of Boromir.
Legacy[]
Three days after Boromir's death, his brother Faramir saw his funeral boat passing down the Anduin. Men of Gondor found Boromir's Great Horn, broken in twain, and brought it to his father. This drove Denethor to despair, and when compounded with Faramir's later seemingly-mortal wounding and his knowledge of Mordor's indomitable might, he lost his mind. Many, including Faramir, often lamented Boromir's passing as Sauron readied his forces to attack, noting that his loss would be keenly felt by Gondor on the field of battle.

First, the land of Ithilien remained largely depopulated due to its close proximity to Minas Morgul and the threat it posed. Second, the invasion left the ancient capital of Gondor, Osgiliath, in ruins. Last, the poisoned wounds received by Boromir shortened his lifespan, leaving him shrunken and in constant pain.

His disability resulted the appellations 'The Lame' and 'Clubfoot' being attached to his name. The latter was an insult used by Túrin during his confrontation with Brandir following Niënor's death.
Brandir was a man of gentle mood, lover of plants and skilled healer. He was against open war with the Orcs because he hoped to preserve his people by silence and secrecy.
When Túrin Turambar arrived in the Forest of Brethil, Brandir was opposed to him and suspected that Túrin would bring misfortune onto the community. However he took Túrin, who was dying of grief after the death of Finduilas, into his house and tended him until he recovered. Later on, Brandir also accepted the woman Níniel, whom he soon secretly fell in love with.
During Túrin's foray to kill the dragon Glaurung, Brandir observed the drama from afar and overheard Glaurung telling Niënor who she really was. He confessed his love to her and attempted to dissuade her from suicide, but she nonetheless flung herself into the Taeglin. On his way back, Brandir came across Dorlas, who had abandoned his companions. He cursed the coward for not his treachery and killed Dorlas when the deserter attacked him.

War of the Ring
Merry was often considered the most perceptive and intelligent of the hobbits, for example, knowing of the One Ring and its power even before Frodo Baggins left the Shire. He guarded Bag End after Bilbo's party, protecting Frodo from the various and often unwanted guests. He also was the force behind ""the Conspiracy"" of Sam, Pippin, Fredegar Bolger and himself to help Frodo. Thus, even before the Quest of the Ring began, Merry was well prepared and organized; he assembled their gear and brought ponies. As a Brandybuck he also had a key to the gate in the High Hay. This shortcut through the Old Forest served them well, because they avoided the Black Riders and met Tom Bombadil, who helped them. At the Barrow-downs, Merry acquired his sword, a work of Westernesse.
Merry with his good friend Pippin
At Bree, he was not present in the Prancing Pony when Frodo foolishly put on the Ring; but was outside taking a walk, and was nearly killed by the Nazgûl who arrived. At Rivendell, he was seen studying maps and plotting their path. His approval to the Fellowship came with only a little less reluctance than Pippin's; they were the two selected to relay news to the people of the Shire about Frodo's journey, but in the end Gandalf, believing in the friendship and loyalty shown to Frodo and Sam, requested that Elrond allow the two hobbits to come along. At Amon Hen he was captured along with Pippin by a band of Saruman's fighting Uruk-hai, but he made a good account for himself, and Boromir valiantly defended him, though Boromir died in the attempt.
Merry and Pippin in Fangorn Forest, by Raoul Vitale
After being captured by the Uruks, Uglúk crudely tried to bandage Merry's head wound. Despite this, a scar would remain on Merry's head forever. The Uruks then gave to them an Orc drink, which would keep the Hobbit alive during the fast march towards Isengard. When they neared Fangorn Forest, Grishnákh began searching them, attempting to find the One Ring, which he believed they carried. Before he was able to escape with the hobbits, Éomer's éored attacked and all of the Orcs, including Grishnákh, were slain. During the confusion of the battle Merry and Pippin were able to escape into Fangorn Forest.
Escaping with Pippin into Fangorn Forest, Treebeard and the newly risen Gandalf the White met him. Along with Pippin, he drank significant amounts of Ent-draught, which contributed to speedy gains in height and hair growth. Accompanying Treebeard to the Entmoot, and later to Isengard, he and Pippin were set as guardians following Saruman's fall. It was here that Merry encountered King Théoden of Rohan, and was reunited with the remaining members of the Fellowship (save Frodo and Sam).
Separated from Pippin when Gandalf took the latter to Gondor, Merry swore fealty to Théoden and became his squire. Without permission from his liege,[1] he rode to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the care of young Dernhelm (who, unbeknownst to Merry, was actually Théoden's niece Éowyn). When the Nazgûl attacked the Riders of Rohan and Théoden was injured, Merry and Éowyn faced the Witch-king of Angmar alone. Here, Merry's companion revealed herself to be Éowyn. Battling both Fellbeast and the Nazgûl alone, Éowyn was well assisted by Merry's crucial move: his sword, was one of the few weapons able to pierce the Ringwraith's form, but at a great expense to himself. He stabbed the Witch-king behind the knee as he was about to kill Éowyn. This was enough to allow Éowyn to finish off the Witch-king. Merry heard Théoden's last words, but went unnoticed by the honor escort of Riders and was found wandering the city by Pippin. He was saved by the healing of Aragorn and recovered fully, leaving Minas Tirith to tend to the wounded Pippin at the Field of Cormallen.
For his bravery in battle, King Éomer, as the new King of Rohan, knighted him and gave him the name of ""Holdwine"". During the Scouring of the Shire, he was in the forefront of the Battle of Bywater, using the Horn of Rohan presented to him by Éowyn.[2]

Later life
Upon their return he and Pippin both married. They were also the tallest of hobbits - Meriadoc being the slightly taller of the two - taller even than the legendary Bandobras ""Bullroarer"" Took, due to their having drunk large amounts of Ent-draught. Merry married Estella Bolger some time after the end of the Third Age. He became the Master of Buckland in SR 1432 (FA 11), living at Brandy Hall and Crickhollow. He wrote Old Words and Names in the Shire. Although he was not recorded as having any children within the family trees, he had at least one son. At the age of 102, Merry returned to Rohan and Gondor with Pippin, dying there some time after the year FO 63. He was laid to rest in Gondor, and when Elessar died in FO 120, he and Pippin were entombed beside the great king.[3]",

186,FA 262,FA 355,Male,,,Bëor,Men,,Unnamed wife,"Bëor was originally named Balan. He and his folk were the first of Mankind to encounter the Ñoldor of Beleriand when King Finrod Felagund happened upon their camp in Ossiriand in the year FA 310. After years of wandering westwards in search of the High Elves (or the Valar, of whom the Bëorians had heard rumor from the lesser Elves they had met in the east), Bëor was eager to establish good relations with Finrod, and the two strove to understand each other. The language barrier was not a major problem due to the similarities between the tongue of the Bëorians, which had been influenced by the Elves they had met earlier, and the Sindarin tongue. In the tongue of his people, called Taliska, Bëor was named 'Balan'. The name he is more commonly called by, Bëor was actually the Taliska word for 'vassal', which he earned in the service of Felagund.[citation needed]

Bëor and his people settled first in Ossiriand but were at odds with the Green-elves that already dwelt there, for the men competed with the Elves for food and natural resources. Therefore, on the advice of Felagund, Bëor led his people to Estolad, the encampment, in the realm of Amrod and Amras, sons of Fëanor. There the people of the first house became more numerous and were enriched by the teachings of the Eldar. Bëor, however, was not content and wanted to leave Estolad and enter instead into the service of King Finrod. He committed the rule of his people to Baran, his son, and departed with Finrod to his realm of Nargothrond. There Bëor continued his service, and he returned never to Estolad. He died in the year 355 of the First Age at the age ninety-three, having spent 44 years in the service of Felagund. His death was greatly lamented by King Finrod and his people, who witnessed for the first time the Gift of Ilúvatar: Death. But in the end Bëor gave up his life willingly and died in peace, a thing previously unheard of by the Elves, who wondered much at the strange lives of Men.
Bëor was held among the Wise of the Edain and was revered by many among the Eldar. He laid the foundations for cooperation between the Eldar and the Edain in years to come and was the forefather of such heroic figures as Barahir, his son Beren Camlost, Túrin Turambar, Tuor his cousin, and Eärendil the Mariner (who was technically a half elf), son of Tuor.[1]",

Thus Bór and his sons swore allegiance to Maedhros.[3] Eventually he and his people proved faithful to the Ñoldor and Edain unlike the treacherous people of Ulfang. Most of them were wiped out during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, which took place in FA 472.[2][4]

Calimehtar was a good friend and ally of the Northmen, whose leader Marhwini warned him in TA 1899 that the Wainriders were planning a new invasion of Gondor. To pre-empt this, Calimehtar assembled an army in Ithilien which he marched north, also sending cavalry over the Undeeps to harass the unguarded enemy positions there. Calimehtar and his Northmen allies finally met the Wainriders on Dagorlad where they defeated them. Narmacil II's death had been avenged.

This oath took the seven brothers to Middle-earth during the First Age, where they established realms in exile, waged war against armies of Morgoth, fought their own Elvish kind on occasion, and eventually brought ruin upon themselves.[6]
Caranthir's realm was in Thargelion in East Beleriand, and was sometimes called Dor Caranthir (Caranthir's land); his abode was on the shores of Lake Helevorn.[7] Because his realm bordered the great Dwarvish Kingdoms of Nogrod and Belegost in the Blue Mountains, he became very wealthy controlling much of the trade coming through the Dwarf-Road.
He rescued the Edain lady Haleth and her people, the Haladin, when they were besieged by Orcs. He then saw the bravery and valour of Men, and offered the Haladin settlement in the North, but Haleth, thanking him, refused and left, eventually settling in Brethil.[8]
In FA 455, after the Dagor Bragollach, Caranthir was forced to flee Thargelion and headed south with his brother Amrod. Two years later, the sons of Ulfang, Uldor, Ulfast and Ulwarth swore allegiance to Caranthir[9] but were faithless later in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad.[10]

Castamir was not in line for the throne, but his royal background had made him the Lord of Ships under the previous king, Valacar. His lineage and influence left him in a position to challenge the new king, Eldacar, who was only half Dúnadan, and half Northmen. As King Valacar's only son, Eldacar was the legitimate heir to the throne, but his half Northmen lineage angered those who believed in a pure Dúnedain royalty. Capitalizing on these feelings, Castamir was able to incite rebellion and besiege Eldacar within the capital Osgiliath in TA 1437 of the Third Age. The city was set on fire by Castamir's troops, destroying the famed Dome of Stars. Shortly thereafter, Eldacar fled the city and went into exile in Rhovanion, to the north. With the defeat of the king, Castamir seized the throne.[2]
For ten years Castamir ruled Gondor with an iron fist, while Eldacar quietly regained support. Castamir ruled cruelly, and committed many foul deeds, including executing Eldacar's own son, Ornendil. At first the people of Gondor tolerated Castamir because of his pure Númenórean blood, but as Castamir proposed to move the royal seat to Pelargir and because of his many cruel acts, the people and cities of Anórien and Ithilien turned against him. So, in TA 1447, when Eldacar returned with an army from Rhovanion, the people of Gondor sided with him against the Usurper. Castamir was defeated at the Battle of the Crossings of Erui, the decisive battle of the Kin-strife as this period came to be known and was killed during the battle by Eldacar personally.
Castamir's influence did not end there. Remnants of his forces, and his surviving sons, retreated from the battle to the port of Pelargir and after a year long siege, escaped by ship to Umbar, far to the south. These descendants of Castamir became the Corsairs of Umbar, fierce pirates who terrorized the coasts of Gondor with the help of the men of Harad. They were perhaps the greatest threat to Gondor for nearly 400 years, commanding massive fleets of ships. Their most infamous exploit was the Raid of Pelargir in TA 1634, in which a Corsair armada led by Castamir's great-grandsons Angamaitë‎ and Sangahyando‎ sailed up the river Anduin to the port of Pelargir, deep in Gondor's territory. This raid coincided with King Minardil's visit, and he was slain by the Corsairs in the attack.
Castamir's descendants remained a significant threat until TA 1810, when King Telumehtar of Gondor retook Umbar. In this battle the last descendants of Castamir were killed.[1][2]",

When Thingol summoned the dwarves to add the Silmaril to the dwarves' necklace, the Nauglamír, the dwarves killed Thingol because of the disagreement between the dwarves and Thingol. But the elves killed all the dwarves except for the two dwarves. The two surviving dwarves went to Nogrod and gathered a large dwarf army to avenge the deaths of the dwarves. And they attacked Doriath. At the Battle in the Thousand Caves, Celeborn fights, but the dwarves win the battle and take the Silmaril and the Nauglamir. Later, one of the surviving elves goes to Beren and tells him what happened. Beren ambushes the dwarves with the green elves and the Ents. Celeborn fought in the Battle of Sarn Athrad too and the Elves won the war. The Silmaril was taken back from the Dwarves. Doriath was re-established and ruled by Dior, the son of Beren. Celeborn's distrust of the dwarves begins at this time. Then news of the Silmaril's presence in Doriath comes to the Sons of Fëanor. Feanor's sons demand that the Silmaril be given to them. When Dior refuses, Feanor's sons attack Doriath. Celeborn fights in the Ruin of Doriath, but Feanor's sons win the war. But they cannot get the Silmaril back, for Dior's daughter Elwing flees to the Havens of Sirion with the Silmaril. Dior is killed and Doriath is destroyed. Celeborn flees to the Havens of Sirion. Learning that the Silmaril was in the Havens of Sirion this time, the sons of Feanor attacked the Havens of Sirion this time. Celeborn fought in the Third Kinslaying, but the sons of Feanor won the war. But they still could not capture the Silmaril, because Elwing threw herself into the sea with the Silmaril. After Celeborn fought in the War of Wrath and Beleriand was destroyed, Celeborn remained in Middle-earth with Galadriel.

Second Age[]
Celeborn and Galadriel likely lived for a time in Lindon, a coastal region west of the Blue Mountains. Gil-galad was High King of the Elves who dwelt there. Many of the Elves in Harlindon, a part of Lindon south of the Gulf of Lune, were Sindarin Elves like Celeborn, and so he may have ruled a fiefdom there under Gil-galad.
Galadriel and Celeborn together, by Anna Kulisz
Then, early in the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel are said to have moved eastward into Eriador with a number of Elves in their following. They may have lived for a while near Lake Evendim. Their daughter Celebrían was born at around this time. They began to move eastward again around the year SA 700 because Galadriel sensed a growing evil in Middle-earth that she felt duty-bound to oppose.
The realm of Eregion was founded in SA 750, and Galadriel and Celeborn are said to have dwelt there for a time along with Celebrimbor and the Elven-smiths. The Elves of Eregion had dealings with the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm nearby, but Celeborn still distrusted Dwarves and would not enter Khazad-dûm, although the Dwarves there had nothing to do with the destruction of Doriath.
The Elves of Eregion also had contact with the Elves of Lothlórien on the other side of the Misty Mountains. According to one story, Galadriel went to dwell in Lothlórien around SA 1350 to SA 1400 while Celeborn remained in Eregion. However, in other versions of the story, both Galadriel and Celeborn stayed in Eregion.
Sauron came to Eregion in a fair disguise as Annatar the ""Lord of gifts"" in SA 1200, and deceived the Elven-smiths, who began forging the Rings of Power under his instruction in SA 1500. Sauron forged the One Ring to rule the others around SA 1600, and Celebrimbor hid from him the Three Elven Rings of Power that he had made, without Sauron's knowledge. Enraged, Sauron eventually attacked Eregion in SA 1697.
Celeborn as depicted by Angus McBride for the Middle-earth Collectible Card Game (1995)
Celeborn led a sortie from Eregion to meet the vanguard of Sauron's army. He was able to drive the enemy back long enough to join forces with Elrond, who brought reinforcements from Lindon. But Sauron's army was greater than their combined forces and Eregion soon fell. Celebrimbor was killed, and Sauron took the Nine Rings and at least six of the Seven rings. Sauron would eventually be driven back to Mordor in SA 1701 with the aid of the Númenóreans.
The movements of Galadriel after the fall of Eregion are unclear. But Celeborn went to Rivendell to help strengthen elves defenses against Sauron. He fought in First Siege of Imladris, Battle of the Gwathló and War of the Last Alliance.

Third Age[]
Celeborn and Galadriel lived for a while in Rivendell, the home of Elrond. At some point, they may have travelled to the coastal region of Belfalas in the south to be near the sea.[citation needed]
Celeborn and Galadriel's daughter Celebrían married Elrond in TA 109. Elrond and Celebrían had three children: twin sons Elladan and Elrohir, born in TA 130, and a daughter, Arwen, born in TA 241.
Around TA 1050, the Necromancer, who was actually Sauron, built the stronghold of Dol Guldur across the Anduin from Lothlórien. Celeborn and Galadriel are said to have returned to Lothlórien to investigate the Necromancer and ensure the safety of Lothlórien. But after a time, they once again departed, possibly for Rivendell. Lothlórien remained under the rule of King Amroth.
In the war with Angmar Celeborn fought in the second siege of Imladris, the fall of Fornost, and the Battle of Fornost. Then a Balrog awoke in Khazad-dûm in TA 1980. Many of the Elves of Lothlórien fled, including Amroth's lover Nimrodel. Amroth followed Nimrodel and he later perished at sea. Lothlórien was left without a leader, so Celeborn and Galadriel returned there and became the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien in TA 1981. They ruled the realm from Caras Galadhon, the City of the Trees.
Celebrían was on her way to Lothlórien to visit her parents in TA 2509 when she was captured by Orcs on the Pass of Caradhras. Her sons Elladan and Elrohir rescued her, but the horror of the experience remained with Celebrían and she decided to leave Middle-earth the next year to dwell in the Undying Lands.
In TA 2941, Sauron was driven out of Dol Guldur by the White Council - of which Galadriel was a member. However, Sauron had been prepared for the attack and returned to Mordor. He sent three Nazgûl led by Khamûl to reoccupy Dol Guldur in TA 2951.
Aragorn came to Lothlórien in TA 2980 and was betrothed to Arwen, who was there visiting her grandparents.
Celeborn meets the Fellowship of the Ring, in the 2001 film
War of the Ring[]
In December of 3018, Elladan and Elrohir brought word to Celeborn and Galadriel of the Fellowship of the Ring's quest to destroy the One Ring. The Fellowship arrived in Lothlórien on January 15, 3019, and was brought to Caras Galadhon to meet Celeborn and Galadriel on January 17.
Celeborn at first welcomed Gimli despite his distrust of Dwarves and said he hoped that there could be friendship between their peoples once more. Then he learned that the Balrog had been disturbed by an expedition of Dwarves to Khazad-dûm led by Balin several years before, and that the Balrog had attacked the Fellowship resulting in the loss of Gandalf the Grey. Celeborn was angry at first and regretted allowing the Fellowship to enter Lothlórien, but Galadriel soothed him and he apologized to Gimli.[4]
Celeborn promised to help the Fellowship however he could. On the eve of their departure from Lothlórien, he discussed what route they might take, and offered them boats for their journey down the Great River Anduin. The next day, on February 16, Celeborn and Galadriel prepared a feast for the Fellowship and gave them gifts. Celeborn advised them further about navigating the Anduin.[5]
Lothlórien was attacked thrice by forces from Dol Guldur during the War of the Ring: on March 11, 15, and 22. Each time, the Galadhrim led by Celeborn and Galadriel repelled them. After the destruction of the One Ring and Sauron's defeat, Celeborn and Galadriel crossed the Anduin and destroyed Dol Guldur. The shadow was lifted from Mirkwood.
Later Third Age[]
On April 6, Celeborn met Thranduil, King of the Woodland Realm and father of Legolas, in Mirkwood. They renamed the forest the Wood of Greenleaves. Thranduil retained kingship of the northern part of the forest, while the center part was given to the Beornings and the Woodmen of Western Mirkwood. Celeborn claimed the southern part of the forest below the Narrows of the Forest to be part of Lothlórien. This region was named East Lórien.
Celeborn and Galadriel accompanied their granddaughter Arwen to Minas Tirith, where she wed Aragorn, now King of Gondor, on Mid-year's Day. Celeborn and Galadriel then travelled to Rohan and attended the funeral of King Théoden. On the way home, they met with Treebeard at Isengard.
When Celeborn and Galadriel parted from Aragorn, Celeborn said to his granddaughter's husband: ""Kinsman, farewell! May your doom be other than mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!""[6]
Celeborn may have been anticipating the day when his own wife would depart for the Undying Lands while he remained in Middle-earth. On September 13, Celeborn and Galadriel crossed the Redhorn Pass to return to Lothlórien.

Fourth Age[]
Galadriel left Middle-earth to return to the Undying Lands in 3021 at the end of the Third Age. Celeborn remained in Lothlórien, but after a few years he began to grow weary. He went to Rivendell to live with his grandsons Elladan and Elrohir for a while in the early part of the Fourth Age. Eventually, Celeborn went to the Grey Havens and sailed for the Undying Lands where his wife and daughter dwelled. It is said that ""with him went the last living memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.""[7]",

Celebrimbor as a child with his parents in Valinor, by Marya Filatova
Celebrimbor was the son of Curufin, who was the fifth son of Fëanor (son of Finwë and his first wife Míriel) and Nerdanel.[3] In the First Age, he fought in the battles of Kinslaying at Alqualondë, Dagor-nuin-Giliath and Dagor Aglareb. After fighting in the Siege of Angband, Dagor Bragollach, Battle of the Pass of Aglond and Fall of Tol Sirion, he lived with his father and uncle in Nargothrond, staying even after Curufin's exile. After fighting in Nirnaeth Arnoediad, he fought in Sack of Nargothrond, and then escaped and traveled to Gondolin. He fought and survived the Fall of Gondolin and Third Kinslaying. Celebrimbor finally fought in the War of Wrath.  Unlike some of his kin, he remained in Middle-earth afterwards.
Second Age
Celebrimbor settled in Eregion in the Second Age and started dealing with the Dwarves of the realm of Khazad-dûm. In SA 1500, Sauron, calling himself Annatar  (""Lord of Gifts""), befriended the Ñoldor of Eregion. He claimed to be an emissary of the Valar, especially Aulë, and instructed them in the art of ring-making.[4] Celebrimbor distrusted him, but the smiths of Eregion were deceived. Under the guidance and instruction of Sauron, the smiths openly made rings to learn the craft and Celebrimbor himself forged the three Elven rings without assistance from Sauron. But unbeknownst to him, the craft taught by Sauron incorporated a binding magic into the rings.
Celebrimbor and Annatar forging the Rings
In secret, Sauron forged the One Ring, a master ring that would rule all the lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth via its influence over those who used the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on his finger, claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their bearers, the Elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor and the Elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings from him. The greatest of the rings (aside from the One Ring) were created by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron and thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to the One Ring. These were the three Rings of the Elves, the fairest of the Rings of Power. Celebrimbor named them Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after the principal Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water, respectively. He sent the three rings away for safekeeping: Vilya and Narya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel in Lórien. Celebrimbor also sent the mightiest of the seven to Durin III of Khazad-dûm.
Sauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, laying waste to the realm. Celebrimbor was captured in the chaos and was forced, under torture, to disclose the locations of the lesser rings, but he would not reveal the whereabouts of the three greatest of them that he had sent away for safekeeping. Celebrimbor died from his torment; his body was shot with arrows and hung upon a pole, and was later paraded as a banner when Sauron attacked the Grey Havens.[5] Celebrimbor was the last direct descendant of the line of Fëanor, save perhaps for his father's brother Maglor, whose fate was unknown and was said by some legends to still wander the shores of the Sea. It was unknown whether he married, no children were recorded.
Celebrimbor, by David Greset
However, related to the House of Fëanor were the Kings of Arnor and the Kings of Gondor, descendants of Celebrimbor's great-grandfather Finwë's union with his second wife Indis. Among them were not just Eärendil, but also Arwen and her husband Aragorn II, who helped bring about Sauron's final defeat in the War of the Ring.",

After a time, Galadriel and Celebrían passed through Khazad-dûm and dwelt in Rivendell. There, she met Elrond, who, though he loved her, said nothing about it.[3]
In TA 109, Elrond wedded Celebrían. She bore him twin sons, Elladan and Elrohir in TA 130, and then a daughter, Arwen in TA 241.[1][3]
In TA 2509, Celebrían was on her way to visit her parents in Lothlórien when she was waylaid by Orcs in the Redhorn Pass of the Misty Mountains. She was then tormented by the Orcs and received a poisoned wound. Her sons arrived much later to rescue her, and Elrond healed her wounds, but Celebrían was never fully-healed in mind and spirit. Horrified and haunted by the memories of her torture, she no longer desired to remain in Middle-earth, and sailed west the next year.[1] Elladan and Elrohir never forgot or forgave their mother's torment, and frequently rode with Aragorn and the Rangers of the North, striking back at the Orcs and other servants of Sauron whenever possible.",

Celegorm was born in Valinor sometime during the Noontide of Valinor. He was very close to Oromë and probably hunted with him in his woods.[3]
After the theft of the Silmarils and the death of their grandfather, he and his father and his brothers took an oath to recover them at any cost. Celegorm, bound to his oath, came to Middle-earth with the exiled Ñoldor and established great realms in exile, joining with their relatives in the House of Fingolfin to wage war against the armies of Morgoth.[4][5] Celegorm and his brother were great lords in the land of Himlad.[6] They were defeated and overwhelmed by the successful sudden assault of Morgoth during the Dagor Bragollach. Celegorm and Curufin lost Himlad and fled south to the marches of Doriath. Not being welcome there due to the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, Celegorm, Curufin, and their people settled in Nargothrond.[7]
While he and his brother lived in Nargothrond, they captured Lúthien Tinúviel, daughter of King Thingol of Doriath. Celegorm wished to marry her, thus forcing a bond of kinship with Thingol. Huan, however, broke with his master and helped Lúthien escape, foiling his scheme. Afterwards, he and his brother were expelled from Nargothrond.[8] Celegorm fell at Menegroth in the Second Kinslaying when the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath to seize a Silmaril in the possession of King Dior of Doriath. Celegorm was slain by Dior in Menelrond.[9]",

During his rule in TA 2509, the Balchoth gathered for an assault upon Gondor. Cirion repaired the forts guarding the Undeeps and prepared as best he could, but could not spare many men to defend this part of his realm, and in despair he sent several messengers to Gondor's old friends the Éothéod, a people now living in the Vales of Anduin to the far north.
Only one man, Borondir, reached the Éothéod capital of Framsburg, and delivered his message to Eorl the Young, their chieftain.
After not receiving any answer for a full year, in TA 2510 Cirion set out west through Anórien, to prevent the Balchoth from crossing the Anduin at the Undeeps. However, the invaders swiftly overran the defences and crossed into the northern province of Calenardhon.
The army of Gondor was defeated and driven back across the river Limlight to the Field of Celebrant. In what was probably a coordinated attack, Orcs came out of the Misty Mountains, and assailed Gondor's flank from the west, driving them towards the Anduin. All hope was lost, when unlooked for came the riders of Éothéod out of the north. Together the Éothéod and the army of Gondor defeated the Balchoth and Orcs in the Battle of the Field of Celebrant, driving them into the great river.
The Oath of Cirion and Eorl, by artist Anke Eissmann
Cirion was a wise man, and saw that he could use the Éothéod further. He told Eorl that he would leave Calenardhon in his care, and meet Eorl again in three months' time. Back at Minas Tirith, Cirion ordered some of his most trusted servants to go to the Firien Wood in Anórien, and in secret clear the way to the summit of the hill of Amon Anwar.
Three months later, Cirion, his son Hallas, the Prince of Dol Amroth, and two other councillors of Gondor set out for Calenardhon, and Cirion met with Eorl. They ascended Amon Anwar, and Cirion revealed the Tomb of Elendil, built in secret on this hill, as it formed the centre of the Gondor of old. At this secret place, he revealed his plan to give Calenardhon as a free gift to the Éothéod, so that there should be a perpetual friendship between the Éothéod and the people of Gondor. On the behalf of his people, Eorl accepted this deal, swearing the Oath of Eorl and becoming the first King of Rohan.[3]

Though not pleased that he was away for a year, she waited for him patiently.[4]

However, Curufin and Celegorm were not in their lands when she arrived, thus Aredhel left and traveled south and was lost in Nan Elmoth. Years later, Aredhel and her son Maeglin left Nan Elmoth, and Eöl pursued them, only to be brought to Curufin. Though they had no love for him and scorned him, they did not slay him and allowed him to continue on his way.[8]
The two brothers fortified their realms with great strength and held them until the Dagor Bragollach. However, following the battle, the two brothers were defeated and had to flee with their people to Nargothrond, where Finrod welcomed them.[9]
Curufin with his brother Celegorm in Nargothrond, by Jenny Dolfen
Shortly after, Beren also came to Nargothrond to remind Finrod of the oath he had sworn, and claim his help. Finrod decided to help Beren, but Celegorm and Curufin, remembering their Oath, persuaded the people of Nargothrond not to follow him, and not to wage open war against Morgoth, making them fearful. Finrod therefore had to leave with a handful of warriors, including Beren, and later died. His nephew Orodreth was left to rule in his stead, but real power rested with Celegorm and Curufin.[10][note 1]
He and his brother went hunting with Celegorm's hound Huan, then found Lúthien, daughter of Thingol, as she fled to find Beren. Feigning to help her, they took her captive and brought her to Nargothrond, for Celegorm had become enamoured and would have Thingol give him her hand. However, Huan helped Lúthien to flee, and they freed Beren and other thralls from Sauron. As these thralls returned, bearing news of the death of Finrod, the people of Nargothrond perceived the two brothers' treachery, and though Orodreth would not let them be slain, he cast them from Nargothrond.

The two brothers met Lúthien and Beren as they fled, and Curufin fought with Beren losing the knife Angrist in the struggle. Defeated, he had to flee with Celegorm, but sought to slay Lúthien even as he did, and shot Beren instead.[10]
Due to Celegorm and Curufin's deeds, Thingol and Orodreth would lend no aid to Maedhros as he sought to unite Elves, Dwarves, and Men in what was called the Union of Maedhros.[11]
Curufin fell in the Second Kinslaying, when the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath to seize the Silmaril in the possession of the Elvish King Dior. His brothers Celegorm and Caranthir died with him during the assault.[12]",

Early history[]
Círdan, born Nowë, was kin of both Elwë and Olwë, lords in the host of the former.[1] Círdan was said to have been one of the most skilled Elves in building ships during the Great Journey, especially when the Elves dwelt by the Sea of Rhûn.[1] During the push westward, seeking to go to Valinor, Nowë and his followers kept going where most of his kin fell away throughout the journey.  Despite Nowë's great eagerness to see the light of Valinor (his ""greatest desire""), he loyally searched for Elwë upon his disappearance.  Because of this, the Teleri missed the first trip on Tol Eressëa to Valinor, on which went their kin, the Ñoldor and the Vanyar.  They took for their king Olwë, and while waiting for Ulmo to return for them, Nowë led in learning the art of making and sailing ships, growing impatient. From this profession, he took the name ""Círdan"" which means ""shipwright"" in Sindarin. The Teleri also developed a great friendship with Ossë.  At the same time, although most of the Teleri had given up, Círdan sought Elwë longer and harder than most of his kin, partly because of his love for him and his allegiance.
Because of this, Círdan came to the shores too late during the second embarking of Eressëa.  He came to the sands to find them departed, and as he stood forlorn he saw far-off a glimmer of light upon Eressëa as it vanished into the West over Belegaer. Then he cried aloud: ""I will follow that light, alone if none will come with me, for the ship that I have been building is now almost ready.""
But into his heart came a message from the Valar which warned him that his ship could not endure the voyage, nor would any ship for many years, until the time when his work be of utmost worth, remembered in song. Círdan answered in abeyance and saw a vision of a ship.
Círdan, by David Greset
Foundation and Return of the Ñoldor[]
Círdan, therefore, remained with those Teleri who had chosen to stay east of the Sea for love of Ossë, and became their lord.  The folk became known as the Falathrim, ""people of the foaming shore"", and dwelt in the Falas by the sea.  There they built many ships, and the cities Eglarest and Brithombar, and found pearls which they sent to their overlord, King Thingol of Doriath, who was once Elwë.
When Morgoth broke forth in the First Battle of Beleriand in YT 1497, Círdan was cut off and unable to come to Thingol’s aid.  Further, although Thingol conquered with the help of the Laiquendi, the Falathrim were driven to the very edge of the sea, where they were besieged for some months, until the return of the Ñoldor when Fëanor struck Morgoth from the north.  The siege of the Falas was abandoned as the Orcs were ordered northward to help their master, where they were all destroyed by Celegorm.  The Falas were saved.
Círdan attended the Mereth Aderthad with many of his people, where he swore oaths of friendship with the Ñoldor, and quite possibly met and befriended his later neighbours and friends Turgon and Finrod.  Although Turgon eventually moved from Vinyamar to faraway Gondolin, Círdan’s friendship with Finrod was lasting, and Círdan became a close advisor to the Ñoldor.  Círdan was, after all, a relative of his, being related (probably quite closely) to Olwë, Finrod’s grandfather.

Early First Age[]
When the tales began spreading (sown by Morgoth) of the Kinslaying of Alqualondë, Círdan, being very wise even at that time, was greatly troubled, feeling that these rumours sprouted from great malice.  Knowing the jealousy and dissension among the Ñoldor, he guessed that the malice was that of the kinslayers.  Therefore he dutifully sent messages to his overlord Thingol, telling him all that he had heard.  This resulted in the banishment of Quenya and greater strife between the Sindar and the Ñoldor.
Círdan may have assisted in the Dagor Aglareb, but this is unknown.  He did not take part in the Dagor Bragollach, as he was far away and not directly attacked, if even he had time to come to the aid of his allies.  Nevertheless, Círdan made up for his lack of participation in the second assault on Hithlum, coming to the timely aid of Fingon when he was most needed.  They sailed up the Firth of Drengist, then struck the unsuspecting orcs from the west, giving victory to the Elves.
Círdan in The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
After the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, many fugitives came for shelter in the Falas.  The Falathrim mariners harassed the Orcs in guerilla attacks from the sea.  But it was only a matter of time before Morgoth attacked.  Then came the disastrous Fall of the Falas. Though both Brithombar and Eglarest were strong, with mighty walls, both fell one at a time due to the power of the Dark Lord's armies.  The Elves fought valiantly, but the walls were broken and most of the Falathrim killed or enslaved.  Barad Nimras was cast down, and the Falas laid to waste.  But Círdan and some of his followers escaped by sea, and he took with him Gil-galad, one of the last of the princes of the Ñoldor.  They came to the Isle of Balar and founded a new kingdom, but kept a foothold at the Mouths of Sirion, keeping ships hidden in the reeds there, making a refuge for all who fled thither.
Lord of Balar[]
Turgon, receiving the dreadful news of the Havens fall, requested that Círdan send mariners to seek Valinor and the aid of the Valar.  Círdan built seven swift ships and sent them westward.  None returned, save for only one mariner of the Gondolindrim.  The way to the West was closed.
Eventually, Círdan served as messenger, when Ulmo delivered him a message for Orodreth, warning of the doom of Nargothrond, and ordering him to shut his gates and cast down the bridge.  The warning went unheeded, resulting in the Fall of Nargothrond.
After news came to Balar of the Fall of Gondolin, Gil-galad was proclaimed High King of the Ñoldor.  Círdan soon after became a fast friend of the young half-elf Eärendil son of Tuor and Idril, who had grown up essentially under his shadow, and was apprenticed to him.  Círdan aided Eärendil in building the ship Vingilot, giving him advice and help.  Círdan doubtless remembered his vision, and this ship was indeed a fulfillment of it.
Círdan and Gil-galad came with their armies from the Isle of Balar too late to prevent the disastrous Third Kinslaying when the Havens of Sirion were ambushed and many fell.  But Eärendil was not there, rather on a voyage, and the Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien had been spirited away by Elwing his wife.  Thus, wielding the Silmaril, Eärendil came to Valinor and found the forgiveness of the Valar. From that time on, Círdan was given foresight surpassing that of any of the Elves, perhaps some special grace of the Valar for his deeds in this world-changing episode (like the return of Glorfindel, who also contributed significantly).  After the War of Wrath, Círdan, heeding the bidding of the Valar long ago, once more obediently abstained from finding his heart’s desire and going West, but with a small following remained in Middle-earth.
Second Age[]
The continents were shifted, but Círdan still took up his abode by the sea, at the Grey Havens, which the Elves built in the newly-formed Gulf of Lune whence the Eldar could sail the Straight Road, but most of them were unwilling at first to forsake the lands they fought in and preferred to linger there. There he welcomed the friendly and then-unfallen Númenóreans, making friends with Vëantur, chief of the mariners of Tar-Elendil, and later teaching Aldarion of ships (both management and construction) and port architecture, doubtless being the foremost authority on both.
Círdan advised against the creation of the Rings of Power when Annatar came, but, like Galadriel, his counsel went unheeded in the midst of the joy and enthusiasm of the Eregion Elves, and especially Celebrimbor. Nevertheless, when the Three Rings escaped the Sack of Eregion, Celebrimbor had appointed him to inherit one of them. He received Narya, the Ring of Fire. Sauron, having revealed himself in the destruction of Eregion and empowered by the One Ring he had forged, invaded Eriador in the same blow; however, his attempt to take Mithlond and Lindon failed with the intervention of the Númenóreans sent by Tar-Minastir.
Círdan joined the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and fought as the lieutenant of Gil-galad. Many fell there, including Gil-galad and Elendil. After the battle, with Elrond, he urged Isildur, Elendil’s first-born, to throw the captured One Ring into Orodruin, where it would be unmade, but Isildur refused.
Third Age[]
After the War of the Last Alliance and the death of Gil-galad, Círdan ruled over Lindon from the Grey Havens. For more than a thousand years they went undisturbed, but at around TA 1050, a shadow began to lengthen.  Though many deemed that Sauron was defeated forever, for the first time in many centuries some evil was stirring and awake.  It was at this time the Istari, sent by the Valar, came. He was the most foresighted of all of them, and alone knew the true purpose of the Istari. He also saw deep into the future of Gandalf, and gave him Narya, his greatest possession albeit one that he had seldom used.
Throughout the war with Angmar, the Elves of Lindon under Círdan supported the Dúnedain of Arnor. With Círdan’s help, King Araphor drove Angmar's armies from Fornost and the North Downs in TA 1409. Combining forces with Rivendell, and the Galadhrim who joined them from beyond the Misty Mountains, they subdued Angmar for some time.
In TA 1975, Elven sailors from Lindon brought a ship to Forochel to rescue the lost king Arvedui. The crew endured a perilous journey, but Arvedui rashly attempted to return that winter, and all aboard perished when the ship foundered. That year, Círdan and the Elves joined with the forces of Gondor and the remaining Northern Dúnedain in the victorious Battle of Fornost. Later, Círdan took control of the abandoned Elendil Stone in Elostirion on the Tower Hills, which could gaze into the lost west and was without a link to the other palantíri.
Nothing more is mentioned of his actions until the War of the Ring in TA 3018 and later TA 3021. Galdor was his messenger to Rivendell and attended the Council of Elrond, speaking with authority on his lord’s behalf.
The last mention of Círdan came with the end of the Third Age.  When the Ringbearers came to Mithlond, Círdan greeted them before the gates.  Although Gandalf, Galadriel, and Elrond passed west on the ship he had built for them, Círdan seems to have remained for a time.
Círdan maintained the haven at least into the Fourth Age, but it was recognized that its purpose would eventually reach an end when no more Elves wished to cross the Sea. At that time, Círdan would abandon the Grey Havens and finally travel the Straight Road himself. After an unknown length of time in the Fourth Age, he sailed west aboard the last ship with the last High Elves, taking with him the last memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.",

While they waited before the battle Damrod told the hobbits of the Enemy's dealings with the Southrons because he had little hope and believed that ""the days of Gondor are numbered, and the walls of Minas Tirith are doomed"".[1]

Sometime later, after his return from Aman, Morgoth loosed an army on Beleriand beginning the First Battle. The lightly armed Laiquendi were driven back to the great hill of Amon Ereb, where Denethor was slain.

After ruling Gondor peacefully for twenty five years, the Watchful Peace ended in TA 2460 with the return of Sauron to Dol Guldur. In TA 2475 Sauron's forces attacked Gondor, unleashing the dreaded Black Uruks, a new race of black Orcs heavier and stronger than any seen before. They destroyed Osgiliath and broke its great stone-bridge leaving it ruined and abandoned from then on. However, the Men of Gondor under the leadership of Denethor I's son Boromir recaptured Ithilien from Sauron's forces, and drove them back east of the river. Denethor I died two years later in the year TA 2477  at the age of 102 after a rule of forty-two years. He was succeeded by his son Boromir.[2][3]",

He was described as subtle and often scornful and could perceive the thoughts of men, including those that dwelled far off, similar to Faramir; but his son was oft moved to pity, whereas Denethor was filled with disdain. It was difficult to deceive him and dangerous to try.
In TA 2976, he married Finduilas of Dol Amroth, daughter of Prince Adrahil II of Dol Amroth.[5] Together, the couple had two sons, Boromir and Faramir. A few years later, in TA 2988, Finduilas died young, leaving Denethor embittered.[6]
He succeeded his father Ecthelion II as twenty-sixth Ruling Steward in TA 2984. During his stewardship, Gandalf was less welcome in Minas Tirith, and his counsels went unheeded.
War of the Ring[]
In later life, Denethor secretly used a palantír to probe Sauron's strength, using it at the top of the White Tower in a secret chamber above the throne room.[7] The effort aged him prematurely, and although Sauron was not able to bend him to his will as he had Saruman, knowledge of the Dark Lord's overwhelming forces exacerbated the bitterness that had taken root at the time of the death of his wife.
Denethor was well aware that Sauron's assault on Gondor would come during his lifetime and prepared accordingly, even though he increasingly came to believe that the struggle would be hopeless. In TA 3018 when Sauron attacked Osgiliath, he found the strength and preparedness of Denethor greater than he had expected or feared. Minas Tirith was fully provisioned for a siege and as war loomed Denethor sent away from the city the old, the women and children and had the beacons of Gondor lit, dispatching errand-riders with the Red Arrow to Théoden of Rohan to summon aid.
Denethor with his palantír in secret, by Anna Kulisz
The death of Boromir, his eldest and favorite son, and the siege and apparent doom of Gondor drove Denethor further along the path of despair. Following this news and the passage of Frodo Baggins through Ithilien he became estranged from Faramir, though Faramir still upheld his father's wishes.[5] Denethor therefore dispatched Faramir with reinforcements to command the garrison at Osgiliath and following the battle there and at the Causeway Forts, sent out a cavalry sortie under the command of Prince Imrahil to rescue his son's retreat. However, Faramir returned severely wounded, breaking Denethor's spirit.
Looking into the palantír, Sauron was able to drive him mad with despair, giving him a hopeless vision of an approaching black fleet from the south, portending that Gondor would fall to Sauron thanks to the Corsairs of Umbar coming to assist in the Siege. Sauron, however, obscured the vision's finer details to hide that those ships would in fact be under the command of Gondor's erstwhile king, Aragorn, who ousted the Corsairs at Pelargir and come by ship to relieve the city. Denethor therefore believed that further resistance was futile, although he remained steadfast in his rejection of the shadow.
He committed suicide on March 15, TA 3019, having ordered his men to erect a pyre for him and Faramir in the Hallows of Minas Tirith. He threw a torch onto the pyre, then broke the white rod of his office over his knee and cast it into the flames, symbolizing the end of his stewardship and the rule of the Stewards. He laid himself down on the table and so perished, clasping the palantír in his hands. His attempt to take the grievously injured and apparently dying Faramir with him was thwarted by the timely intervention of Beregond and ultimately, by Gandalf.[3]
Denethor II ruled as the Steward of Gondor for 35 years, from TA 2984 until his death in TA 3019. The title of Steward was passed to his son, Faramir, who also became the first of the Princes of Ithilien.[8] After his death the Anor-stone would only show Denethor's hands slowly withering in flame, unless the viewer had great strength of will to turn it to other visions.",

Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.
Quest of Erebor[]
Dwalin was the first Dwarf to arrive, alone, at Bag End when the unexpected party planned by Thorin and Gandalf began at Bilbo Baggins' hobbit hole. Wearing a dark-green hood and a golden belt, he walked into Bilbo's home as if expected, which greatly surprised Bilbo. Soon Balin arrived, and he and Dwalin sat talking while Bilbo kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more Dwarves. Later, when Bilbo griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Dwalin and Balin were the first (followed by Fíli and Kíli) to lend a hand. Later still, when the Dwarves filled Bag End with music, Dwalin played on a viol as big as himself.[1] Dwalin lent a green hood and cloak to Bilbo when they set out on their journey.

He was the last King of Durin's Folk to live in the Grey Mountains; shortly after Dáin I was laid to rest in the tombs of the mountain halls, the Grey Mountains were abandoned by the Dwarves.
Dáin I was succeeded by his son Thrór, who returned to the Lonely Mountain and unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim Moria. His younger son Grór founded his own realm in the Iron Hills.[1]",

Dáin followed his grandfather, Grór, in lordship after Náin was killed by the great Orc chieftain Azog during the Battle of Azanulbizar, the final conflict in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, before he could inherit the lordship. Almost immediately after the death of Náin, Dáin rushed up the steps and slew Azog himself with a single blow of his axe, thus avenging his father's death. He was a very young Dwarf at the time, being only thirty-two years of age: by the Dwarves reckoning, he was still a stripling. Dáin's feat was heralded as a magnificent and glorious triumph for one so young. Dáin alone looked past the gate into Moria, and had the wisdom to know that it was impossible for the Dwarves to return while Durin's Bane yet lived.

The Battle of Five Armies[]
Dáin was the friend and cousin of Thorin II Oakenshield, and responded to Thorin's call for help during the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain.[3] Dáin marched with five hundred Dwarven soldiers, exceptionally strong even by Dwarven standards, clad in heavy chainmail and iron boots, and armed with mattocks, shields, and swords. He arrived just in time for the Battle of Five Armies.[4] With Thorin's death in the battle, Dáin became King of Durin's Folk and King under the Mountain, the first not of the main line. After the battle, Dáin thanked the Great Eagles for their timely intervention, crowning their chief with gold and swearing the Dwarves to everlasting friendship with them. He also honored Thorin's commitments to Bard the Bowman and Bilbo Baggins, giving a fourteenth share of the Mountain's treasure to the people of Lake-town, and promising an even greater share to Bilbo, who politely declined to take more than two small chests, filled with silver and gold. Dáin also granted the emeralds of Girion to King Thranduil, who prized them greatly.[5]
The War of the Ring[]
Dáin was a wise and just leader, and brought much wealth to the mountain realm and was on good terms with the Men of Dale to the south and the Elven king of Northern Mirkwood as well, which ensured peace for many years to come. When Balin and other Dwarves decided to reclaim Moria, Dáin initially refused, but Balin insisted on going.[6]

A few months before the Council of Elrond, a messenger from Mordor appeared at the entrance of the Lonely Mountain and offered the Dwarves an alliance with Sauron, asking only in return that the Dwarves share what they knew ""concerning Hobbits"", and help to track down the One Ring, which the messenger described as ""least of rings... a trifle that Sauron fancies.""  The messenger said that, if the Dwarves could deliver the Ring itself, then Sauron would return three of the Rings of Power that originally belonged to the Dwarf-Lords, and Moria would be theirs to possess forever.  On the other hand, the messenger warned that ""things will not seem so well"" if the Dwarves did not help.[6]
Dáin becoming King under the Mountain
Knowing from long and bitter experience that Sauron could not be trusted, Dáin refused to be bribed or blackmailed, and sent the messenger away without an answer by claiming that he needed time to think over the proposal. He instead sent Glóin to Rivendell to consult with Elrond, while Dáin prepared the Lonely Mountain for war.[6]

Death[]
Dáin participated in the War of the Ring's northern campaign but was killed during the Battle of Dale in TA 3019, defending the body of King Brand of Dale before the gates of the Lonely Mountain. He was, by then, an extremely old Dwarf, at the age of two-hundred and fifty-two, but still strong for his age. He was still among the greatest of the Dwarven warriors, a direct descendant of Durin I and his prowess in battle was nearly unmatched.

After news of his death reached Minas Tirith, Gandalf remarked that, as saddened as they must be at Dáin's death, they should be glad that he died in battle, defending his friend's body, as well as amazed that he was still as formidable a warrior as he had been when he was a young dwarf:
""I should call that a heavy loss, if it was not a wonder rather that in his great age he could still wield his axe as mightily as they say he did, standing over the body of King Brand before the gate of Erebor, until the darkness fell.""

Déagol was born some time between TA 2400 and TA 2430. Déagol and Sméagol apparently lived in an extended family under a Matriarch. He became the third bearer of the One Ring, after Isildur, when he found it in the Gladden river (a tributary to the Anduin) with his cousin Sméagol. On Sméagol's birthday in TA 2463 they went fishing (or rather Déagol fished while Sméagol dug in the earth), and a big fish pulled Déagol underwater. It was then that he discovered the One Ring, half-buried in the river-bed. When Sméagol saw the Ring, he stared at it with great desire, and then asked to keep it for his birthday. When his cousin refused, Sméagol became enraged and strangled Déagol to death, hiding the body, which was never found. This deed haunted Gollum for the rest of his life.
Of the Ring's bearers, Déagol carried it for the shortest collective time, possessing it only for no more than a few minutes. By contrast, the next shortest, Samwise Gamgee, carried it for a full day, and all the other Ring-bearers held it for at least a year. Déagol was also the only Ring-bearer never to use the Ring, all the others making use of its gift of invisibility at least once.
It was possible that the Ring had already affected Déagol in a way that made him desire to keep it, explaining his unwillingness to give it to Sméagol.[1]",

During Déor's reign, the Dunlendings began to cause trouble again, after Aldor had driven them out long before. Déor rode west to fight them, but in TA 2710 he learned that Gondor's fortress of Isengard had fallen under Dunlending rule. Isengard's defenses were strong and the Rohirrim were unable to mount a siege, so Déor had to accept for the time being a western threat to his realm.

While dwelling there, he sought after for ""all the tidings and lore"" of the House of Hador from the remnants of the peoples of Hithlum, Dor-lómin, Nargothrond, Doriath, Gondolin, East Beleriand, and the many other lands of Beleriand because he found that ""the glory and sorrow of that House was nearest to his heart"".[3] In particular, he learned of ""the matter of Mîm and his later dealings with Húrin"", though a lot of the lore that he had learned was from Mablung.[4] However, despite ""the little that was remembered among the people of Nargothrond"" of what Gwindor or Túrin himself ever revealed to them, Dírhaval was unable to find out more about the whereabouts of Túrin between his flight from the Kingdom of Doriath and his arrival at Nargothrond.[4] Yet, through much fortune, Dírhaval encountered a very old man named Andvír, who was once a part of the very same outlaw-band that Túrin had once led; it was from Andvír that Dírhaval learned many of the gaps in Túrin's life, and more fully understood the encounter between Mîm and Húrin in Nargothrond.[3][4]
He compiled all of the lore that he had gathered and wrote a very long narn in the alliterative Minlamad thent/estent,[4] telling of the tragedy of Morgoth's curse on Húrin's children: Túrin and Niënor. This lay, the Narn i Chîn Húrin, was highly praised by the Eldar since it was in the Grey-elven tongue. It is the only full account on Túrin's life, and all later writings on the subject fall back on this one.[3]
Dírhaval did not write any other poems or lays, as the Silmaril captured by Beren and Lúthien was in the keeping of Elwing: soon the Sons of Fëanor launched an attack on the exiles in the Havens of Sirion to claim it. Dírhaval was said to be one of those who fell during the Third Kinslaying.[3][5]",

When news of Turgon's death reached Saruman he declared himself Lord of Isengard and took possession of Orthanc which he then fortified. Ecthelion was a Steward of great wisdom but was powerless to prevent the appropriation of Isengard and Orthanc, so he did what he could to strengthen Gondor's defences with what limited resources he possessed, and supplemented Gondor's diminished forces by encouraging outsiders and foreigners that possessed a good character to enter into the service of Gondor and Ecthelion rewarded those individuals that proved their worth.
Aragorn son of Arathorn served Ecthelion, although under the name of Thorongil to hide his true identity. In this guise Aragorn became one of Ecthelion's most trusted and loyal retainers. Thorongil persuaded the Steward to send him to destroy the threat posed by the Corsairs of Umbar, and in TA 2980 the Corsairs were routed in a battle upon the quays, the majority of their fleet was destroyed, and their leader, the Captain of the Haven, was overthrown. Thorongil also advised Ecthelion to listen to the counsels of Gandalf as opposed to those of Saruman, which Ecthelion did willingly. However, the great esteem and many honors that Ecthelion gave to Thorongil and Gandalf incurred the jealousy and anger of Denethor who felt both slighted and threatened.

His reign saw rebellion escalate into full scale civil war, for the nobility of Gondor were not prepared to accept a king with only half Dúnedain heritage. After ascending the throne in TA 1432 the civil war of the Kin-strife broke out. Eldacar reigned for five years until he was besieged in Osgiliath, being forced to flee into exile in Rhovanion by his far relative Castamir the Usurper, who reigned for ten bloody years, beginning with the execution of Eldacar's eldest son, Ornendil. While in exile, Eldacar slowly gathered support from the Northmen and the Dúnedain from the northern parts of Gondor. Castamir's tyrannical rule turned the people of the inland provinces against him and Eldacar saw his chance.
In TA 1447, he marched south with an army from the Rhovanion and was joined by many from the cities and northern provinces of Gondor. The armies of Eldacar and Castamir clashed at the exceptionally bloody Battle of the Crossings of Erui, where many of the high nobility of Gondor perished, but Eldacar was victorious, personally killing Castamir.

Elendil was born in 3119 of the Second Age in Númenor, son of Amandil, Lord of Andúnië and leader of the Faithful (those who remained loyal to the Valar), who maintained a strong friendship with the Elves and preserved the old ways against the practices of Ar-Pharazôn and Sauron. For this Sauron hated Amandil, and by extension Elendil, the most out of all the Númenóreans.[3] He was married to an unnamed Númenórean woman no doubt of the same upbringing and noble blood to which they had two sons: Isildur and Anárion. It is not known whether she followed him to Middle-earth after the Downfall of Númenor.[3]
When Ar-Pharazôn and Sauron were preparing their assault on Valinor, Amandil told him to gather the Faithful in Rómenna and escape to Middle-earth. Elendil did as his father bade, and gathered the Faithful and their wives and children in 9 ships, and waited just off the coast.[3] With them, they took the palantíri, the ""Seeing Stones"" that were given to the Lords of Andúnië by the Elves of Tol Eressëa, and a seedling of Nimloth, the White Tree of Númenor.
When the Downfall came, the great wave that devoured Númenor was coming towards Rómenna when a great storm came out of the West, snapping the sails of his ships and tossing them around in giant waves, and carried him all the way to Middle-earth.[3] With the Downfall, Elendil and his children became the sole surviving descendants of the House of Elros.

His heir and 38th-great-grandson Aragorn spoke these traditional words again when he took up the Crown of Gondor at the beginning of the Fourth Age.
Elendil was welcomed to Eriador by the Elven-king Gil-galad and in SA 3320 he founded the Kingdom of Arnor, building the city of Annúminas as his capital. The five ships carrying Elendil's sons landed further south, where Anárion founded the city of Minas Anor in Anórien, and his son Isildur founded Minas Ithil in Ithilien. They ruled the new realm of Gondor jointly as its Kings from their capital city of Osgiliath. Across the realms towers were built for the palantíri, with which the two kingdoms kept contact.[4]

In time Sauron returned to Mordor and began to rebuild his power. In SA 3429, he attacked seizing Minas Ithil. Isildur went north to take counsel with his father, leaving Anárion in charge of the defence of Gondor. In SA 3434, Elendil and Isildur returned south together with the Elven High King Gil-galad and their combined armies, in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.
After defeating Sauron's armies and advancing into Mordor itself, the armies of Elves and Men settled into a siege of the main tower of Sauron: Barad-dûr. During this siege Anárion was killed.
After seven years of siege, in SA 3441 Sauron came out to personally do battle with his enemies. Elendil, together with Gil-galad, overthrew Sauron, but they were both killed in the process, and Elendil's sword broke when he fell.[5]
Isildur used his father's broken sword to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Vanquished, Sauron's spirit fled. Isildur built a hidden tomb for his father on the summit of the hill of Amon Anwar,[4][6] the midpoint of Gondor. Later, with the creation of the Kingdom of Rohan, the Steward Cirion had Elendil's casket moved to Rath Dínen in Minas Tirith.

As the eldest son of Isildur, Elendur was high in the confidence of his father; he alone of the sons knew the existence of the One Ring in his father's possession and counselled Isildur to turn over the One Ring to the Keepers of the Three Rings.

A depiction of Elladan
Elladan and Elrohir were born in TA 130,[1] and had a younger sister, Arwen. Through their mother Celebrían, they were the only grandsons of Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn of Lothlórien.
In TA 2509, the brothers rescued their mother from her imprisonment by Orcs. Although she was physically healed by Elrond, after fear and torment from the Orcs she lost all joy from Middle-earth, and so she departed for the Undying Lands the next year. Due to this, the twins harbored great hatred for Orcs.[3]
By the year TA 2933, Elladan and Elrohir went riding against Orcs with Arathorn II, the father of Aragorn II Elessar. There Arathorn was slain and his wife and son went to dwell in Imladris, where Elrond received Aragorn as his foster-son, naming him Estel.[4]
War of the Ring[]
When the Fellowship of the Ring formed in Rivendell, the twins' role was to scout the lands and prepare the way for the Fellowship.[5] Later, they traveled along with Halbarad and the Grey Company. They delivered a message from their father concerning the Paths of the Dead and accompanied Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli there. Elladan traveled behind the company, the Dead following after him.[2] They battled on the Fields of Pelennor ""with stars bound to their brows.""[6]
During the Last Debate, Elladan and Elrohir seconded Gandalf's decision to throw a force at the Morannon, saying that Elrond had sent them with that same counsel from Rivendell.[7] Elladan and Elrohir then accompanied Aragorn and fought alongside him at the Battle of the Black Gate.
After the War[]
After the war, Elladan and Elrohir met the escort of Arwen in Lothlórien, and together, they traveled to Minas Tirith.[8] The brothers arrived first and carried a banner of silver. They were followed by Glorfindel and Erestor.[9]

First Age
Elrond Peredhel was the son of Eärendil and Elwing, and great-grandson of Lúthien. He was born in the refuge of the Havens of Sirion in Beleriand late in the First Age, soon before its sack by the Sons of Fëanor. Elrond and his twin brother Elros were captured and raised by Maglor, a son of Fëanor. Though at first there was no great love between them, eventually Maglor took pity on them and cherished them, and eventually grew to love them.[3] By the end of the First Age and the War of Wrath, the Sons of Fëanor were again working alone, suggesting that by this time, Elrond and Elros had left their nominal captivity and traveled to Lindon.
Second Age
Elrond and Elros were given the choice at the end of the First Age to be counted among Men or Elves. Elros chose the Fate of Men and became Elros Tar-Minyatur, the first King of Númenor. Elrond Half-elven chose to be counted among the Elves,[4] and remained in Lindon as captain and herald of Gil-galad, the High King of the Ñoldor.[5]
With the start of the War of the Elves and Sauron in SA 1695, Elrond was sent to Eregion by Gil-galad in an attempt to protect it from the invading forces of Sauron. Unfortunately, Elrond's host arrived too late and was not large enough on its own to defeat Sauron's army. He retreated north with the refugees of Eregion, including Celeborn, only escaping because the forces of Durin III assailed Sauron's army in the rear. It was during the following two years (SA 1697) that Elrond founded Rivendell at the feet of the Misty Mountains, as a sanctuary and stronghold. For the next four years, Rivendell was besieged by Sauron's forces.
With the arrival of the Númenóreans, the army besieging Rivendell was caught between the forces of Gil-galad and Elrond and destroyed. Elrond remained in Rivendell and hosted the first White Council, attended by Galadriel, at which it was decided that Elrond's home, the Last Homely House, would remain the last stronghold west of the Misty Mountains, and that the Three Rings then held by Gil-galad and Galadriel would remain hidden. According to one account Gil-galad at this time gave Elrond Vilya the Blue Ring, though in other accounts Gil-galad kept both Narya and Vilya until the end of the Second Age. It was also here that Elrond first met Celebrían, the daughter of Celeborn and Galadriel.
Elrond in battle during the War of the Last Alliance, as portrayed in the films
Near the end of the Second Age, Elrond rode beside Gil-galad in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, which set out from Rivendell to Mordor in SA 3431. Elrond was Gil-galad's herald during the war against Sauron. The Alliance, which also included Elves from Lothlórien, Men from Arnor and Gondor, and Dwarves likely led by Durin IV, defeated Sauron's army at the Battle of Dagorlad and laid siege to Barad-dûr for seven years. Eventually, Sauron himself was defeated by Elendil and Gil-galad, allowing Isildur to cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger and claim it for himself.
The war took a toll on the forces of both Elves and Men. Gil-galad, Elendil, and his younger son Anárion were killed in the siege. Elrond and Círdan only remained as the commanders of the Elves, and Isildur as High King of the Realms in Exile. Upon discovering that Isildur had claimed the One Ring for himself, Elrond urged Isildur to throw the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, but the seduction of the Ring made Isildur refuse. Isildur claimed the Ring as a weregild for his father and brother, and Elrond (perhaps not fully understanding the nature of the One Ring) acknowledged his claim. Elrond then returned to Rivendell at the end of the war.[6]
Third Age
Elrond riding out of Rivendell, by Robert Zigo
In the year TA 109, Elrond wedded Celebrían. In the year TA 130, the twins Elladan and Elrohir were born, and in TA 241 a daughter, Arwen Undómiel. Elrond lost Celebrían in TA 2510 when she was waylaid by Orcs crossing the Misty Mountains and, unable to recover, took a ship to the Undying Lands.[7][8]
In the later years, he was instrumental in harboring the heirs of Isildur while the line lasted, the most famous of these sons of men was Aragorn II, whom he took in and fostered as his own after his father Arathorn II died in TA 2933. Elrond, foreseeing the boy's difficult future gave him the name Estel, Sindarin for hope. Aragorn grew up in Imladris unaware of his royal lineage until Elrond told him when he had reached his manhood.[9]
He also was a member of the White Council, which was often held in Rivendell, and was a great friend of Gandalf the Grey. He helped Thorin II's expedition to retake the Lonely Mountain by discovering and translating the Moon Writing on Thorin's map.[10]
Upon learning that Aragorn and Arwen had become betrothed in TA 2980, Elrond was sorrowful, knowing that his daughter had made a choice to become mortal and therefore decreed that for such a price she could marry no less a man than the King of Arnor and Gondor.
After Frodo's departure from the Shire with the One Ring, Elrond sent out riders to help guide him back to Rivendell. One of these, Glorfindel, successfully found Frodo and helped him reach Rivendell.[11] On October 25, 3018 he held the Council at which it was decided to attempt to destroy the One Ring. He appeared to have selected the members of the Fellowship other than Frodo and Sam.[12]
Five months later, Elrond sent his sons Elladan and Elrohir with the Rangers of the North to Rohan. Through his sons, Elrond advised Aragorn to take the Paths of the Dead.[13]
Elrond before departing Middle-earth
Elrond remained in Rivendell until the destruction of the One Ring and of Sauron, after which he went to Minas Tirith to surrender the Sceptre of Annúminas to King Elessar and give his daughter Arwen Undómiel away to be married.[14] On September 29, 3021, Elrond left Middle-earth to go over the sea with the other Ring-bearers, never to return.[15]",

Her son was named after her father Beren, Belemir's son.
After the conquest of Dorthonion by the forces of Morgoth after the Dagor Bragollach, Emeldir's husband Barahir stayed behind in Dorthonion with a faithful band of outlaws, which included Beren. Emeldir was charged to lead the women and children of Bëor's folk who had to flee from their homes after the Dagor Bragollach since their land was now taken and ruled by Sauron, Morgoth's commander. Though she would have preferred to defend her husband and son, Emeldir was successful in bringing her charges safely to Brethil where the Haladin (who were also of the Edain) dwelt.

In TA 3002, when Éomer was eleven, Éomund was slain in battle with Orcs. Théodwyn died of grief shortly afterward. Éomund also had a daughter named Éowyn, Éomer's sister. After they were orphaned Théoden adopted them as his own children.
Éomer became the third Marshal of the Mark, and was a strong leader of Men. He was honored highly and trusted by the King, and was close with his cousin Théodred, son of Théoden who loved him like a brother.
His éored hunted down the Uruk-hai that had taken Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took as they camped near Fangorn Forest, slaying them all. He never saw the Hobbits, as they had fled during the battle. Afterwards he met Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas on the plains of Rohan, and he lent them two horses, Arod and Hasufel.
Éomer returned to Edoras and reported meeting the Ranger and his friends and allowing them to go free, a violation of the King's law. Under the poisonous advice of Gríma Wormtongue, he was imprisoned by Théoden, who had grown weak, aged, and suspicious under Saruman the White's influence.
Depiction of Êomer at Helm's Deep by Angelo Montanini
After Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas reunited with Gandalf, the four hastened to Edoras, where Gandalf broke Saruman's influence over Théoden and restored him to health and vitality. Théoden freed Éomer, who offered his sword to Théoden in token of his loyalty. Théoden named Éomer his heir prior to riding away from Edoras to the defense of the Hornburg.
At the Battle of the Hornburg, Éomer was involved in was the defence of the gate where he, Aragorn, and a small band of men left through a back door at the side of the Hornburg and led an assault on the forces attempting to break the gates of the Hornburg. After this attack Éomer and Aragorn attempted to return through the door when Éomer was jumped upon by several Orcs who had laid low during the assault, though Éomer was saved by Gimli, who had secretly followed him out to the gate. When the Deeping Wall was breached, Éomer and Gimli were unable to reach the fortress and instead retreated up Helm's Deep to the Glittering Caves, where they held the Orcs at bay.

Afterwards he rode with Théoden, Aragorn, and Gandalf to Isengard, where they were greeted by Merry and Pippin, who were celebrating their recent victory. Treebeard and his fellow Ents remained as well in order to guard the now imprisoned Saruman and Wormtongue.
After this, Éomer rode with Théoden to Dunharrow, where the Rohirrim were mustering. After receiving the Red Arrow, Théoden agreed to gather a force to help defend the city of Minas Tirith against the impending assault by Mordor. Théoden and Éomer rallied ten thousand men, leaving four thousand behind to guard Rohan before riding to the White City. The army of Rohan managed to arrive at the Pelennor Fields just as Minas Tirith's Great Gate was breached. In the ensuing Battle of the Pelennor Fields Éomer fought gallantly, slaying many foes. But Théoden was fatally crushed by his horse, Snowmane, after being attacked by the Witch-king's fellbeast. Coming upon their corpses, Éomer was driven to temporary madness at seeing Éowyn, his sister, among the King's retinue, apparently dead, and charged in renewed fury at the forces of Mordor. He and Aragorn later met on the battlefield and reaffirmed their loyalty to each other, before returning to the long, grim work of winning the battle.
In the battle's aftermath, Éomer attended to Éowyn in the Houses of Healing, and, with Aragorn and Meriadoc Brandybuck, helped call his sister back to consciousness. Aragorn said that, as broken as Eowyn's heart had been over her unrequited love for Aragorn, her love for her brother was much more real to her, and a much more potent reason for her to live.

Éomer became King of the Mark upon Théoden's death, and attended the final council of war before the Battle of the Black Gate, where Gandalf counseled that the combined forces of Gondor and Rohan must throw a diversionary force of sufficient size against Mordor, with little chance of survival, let alone success, in the slender hope of distracting Sauron long enough to allow Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee to cross Mordor in secret and deliver the One Ring to Mount Doom.  Éomer confessed that he had little understanding of the ""deep matters"" being discussed, but he did not need it.  For him it was enough that Aragorn and his allies had come to Rohan's aid at Helm's Deep, and therefore, Rohan would stand with Gondor in the last battle. Some riders under the command of Elfhelm remained in Minas Tirith as part of the garrison.
Following Sauron's fall, Éomer and his men went back to Edoras to attend to affairs of the kingdom, returning later to bear the body of Théoden back to his home for burial, where Éomer was formally crowned as King.
King Éomer at Aragorn's coronation in the films
Éomer renewed the Oath of Eorl with Aragorn after the latter had been crowned King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom, swearing everlasting friendship between Rohan and Gondor (and legalizing Cirion's grant of Calenardhon to the Éothéod.)
He became known as Éomer Éadig, or ""the Blessed"", because during his reign Rohan recovered from the hurts of the War and became a rich and fruitful land again.  Although Sauron was defeated, the West was never wholly free of enemies, and Elessar and Éomer rode together to war many times.
Éomer had met Lothíriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth during his stay in Gondor, and they were wed. She bore him a son Elfwine, who succeeded his father, after Éomer's death in the year FO 63.",
268,TA 2485,TA 2545,Male,Blond,,Eorl the Young,Men,Rohan,Unnamed wife,"Depiction of Eorl on a tapestry in the films
Eorl was born in TA 2485. His father was Léod, the leader of the people called the Éothéod who lived in the far north near the source of the Anduin. In TA 2501 when Eorl was sixteen years old, Léod was killed by a wild horse that he had tried to tame; for this act the horse was called Mansbane by the Éothéod. Eorl hunted the horse and rather than kill him required that the horse serve him and surrender his freedom as a Weregild. The horse submitted and Eorl renamed him Felaróf. Felaróf became Eorl's steed and was the father of the Mearas, who were the steeds of Eorl's descendants. It was also said that Felaróf would not permit any other man to ride him.
Eorl succeeded his father as the leader of the Éothéod. They were a numerous people with many horses. They needed more room to roam, but there was nowhere for them to go.
On March 25, TA 2510 - when Eorl was twenty-five years old - an errand-rider named Borondir arrived with a message from Cirion, the Steward of Gondor. Gondor was being threatened by Men from Rhûn called the Balchoth, and Cirion sought Eorl's help in defeating them. Eorl agreed to come, because he knew that if Gondor fell, all of Middle-earth would soon be conquered. Borondir was one of several errand riders sent out by the Stewards, but the only one to get through, due to the intervening enemies. Eorl assembled his Council of Elders to prepare to ride south.
On April 6 , Eorl rode forth with an Éoherë - or mounted army - of 7,000 fully armed Riders and several hundred mounted archers. Only a few hundred Riders were left behind to guard the women, children, and elderly. The éoherë rode southward through the Vales of the Anduin - a journey of over 500 miles.
When they passed Dol Guldur in Mirkwood - where Sauron dwelled in secret - a darkness emanated from the fortress, and Eorl turned westward to avoid it. But then a white mist came from the woods of Lothlórien that stood across the River from Dol Guldur, and the Riders were hidden and continued safely on their way and, under the protection of the mist, apparently made the journey unwearyingly at an extraordinary rate of speed.
Eorl arrived at the Field of Celebrant on the morning of April 15. Gondor's army was being attacked on two fronts by the Balchoth and Orcs from the Misty Mountains. Eorl and his Riders attacked the enemy from the rear, slaying many and driving the rest across the River Limlight. South of the Limlight lay the province of Gondor called Calenardhon, and Eorl and his Riders pursued the surviving enemies until the land was free of them.
After the Battle of the Field of Celebrant, Eorl accompanied Cirion to the Mering Stream on the southeastern border of Calenardhon, where they parted company. Cirion asked Eorl to meet him there again in three months and committed Calenardhon to Eorl's care in the meantime.
Statues of Eorl (right) and Cirion erected near the site of their first meeting (The Lord of the Rings Online
When they met again in August of 2510, Cirion brought Eorl to Halifirien, the Hill of Awe, also known as Amon Anwar because, unknown to all but the Steward and those in his deepest confidence, the Tomb of Elendil had stood since being placed there by Isildur after the fall of Sauron. There Cirion offered Eorl the land of Calenardhon as a new homeland for his people in gratitude for their service to Gondor. Eorl was deeply grateful for the Gift of Cirion, whom he admired as the wisest of all men then in Middle-earth. He accepted and he swore an oath that his people would always come to Gondor's aid in time of need. Eorl realized that their peoples needed to remain allies in order to face the growing danger in Middle-earth. Cirion took a similar oath on behalf of the people of Gondor.
Eorl left about half his force to guard Calenardhon and returned to the far north to gather his people and their possessions. He led them back to their new homeland, and it became known as the Mark. In Gondor, the new land of their allies was called Rohan.
Eorl was King of the Mark for 35 years. He chose the hill at the entrance to the valley of Harrowdale to be the site of the town of Edoras. But Meduseld, the Golden Hall, was not completed in Eorl's lifetime, and he dwelled at Aldburg in the Folde. Eorl's son Brego was born in TA 2512.
In TA 2545, Rohan was attacked by Easterlings. The attack was thwarted, but Eorl fell in battle. He was buried in a mound outside Edoras, and his horse Felaróf was buried with him. His son Brego succeeded him as King of Rohan.
Rohan continued to be ruled by the House of Eorl, and the people of Rohan called themselves the Eorlingas, or the Sons of Eorl. The Oath of Eorl was not forgotten. During the War of the Ring, King Théoden of Rohan honored his ancestor's Oath and came to Gondor's aid at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The Oath of Eorl was renewed by Théoden's successor King Éomer, who pledged continued friendship to Aragorn, King Elessar, of the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor.

Éowyn was the second child of Éomund and Théodwyn. Like her brother Éomer, she was related to King Théoden through their mother, the King's sister. Her father was slain and her mother died of illness in TA 3002. Afterwards, Théoden took Éomer and Éowyn in his household and raised them as his children.
War of the Ring
Prior to the War of the Ring, Éowyn was forced to stay in Meduseld and care for her declining uncle for several years, as he was weakened by the influence of Saruman and Gríma Wormtongue. When Gandalf restored the King, he prepared to defend Rohan against Isengard. Since Théoden planned to ride to battle himself, he asked his doorwarden Háma, to suggest a leader for the people in his absence. Háma recommended Éowyn, who, though a woman, was ""fearless"" and ""all love[d] her"".
Éowyn during the exodus to Helm's Deep, by Venlian
Éowyn reluctantly obeyed the King's orders to lead the people of Edoras to shelter in the White Mountains, while Aragorn, Théoden, and the rest of the men bravely faced Saruman's army in the Battle of the Hornburg. When Aragorn passed through Dunharrow to take the Paths of the Dead she confessed her growing feelings for him, but already betrothed, he reluctantly refused her.
When Denethor II urgently called for Théoden's aid against Mordor, Éowyn again, begged to be allowed to ride to battle, but Théoden refused.
Éowyn beside Théoden her uncle, as seen by Angelo Montanini
Resentfully, she disguised herself as a man, taking the alias Dernhelm, and rode to Minas Tirith on her horse Windfola. She took Meriadoc Brandybuck along because he likewise wanted to follow his friends to battle, but had been refused by Théoden. Because Éowyn weighed less than a man of similar height, Windfola was able to bear both her and Merry.[1]
In the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, she fought in Théoden's escort; when he and his company were attacked by the Witch-king of Angmar, Lord of the Nazgûl, she and Merry were the only riders who did not flee. As Théoden lay mortally wounded and crushed beneath Snowmane, Éowyn challenged the Witch-king, who boasted that ""no living man may hinder me"". In answer, she removed her helmet, releasing her hair, which ""gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders"", and declared, ""But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. Éowyn I am, Éomund's daughter... Begone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.""[3]

In a rage, the Witch-king attacked her, but she clove the head of his winged steed. The Witch-king shattered her shield with a blow of his mace, breaking her arm, but stumbled when Merry stabbed his leg from behind with the Barrow-blade. Éowyn drove her sword through the Witch-king's head, killing him[3] and fulfilling Glorfindel's prophecy from a thousand years earlier, at the Battle of Fornost, that ""not by the hand of man"" would the Witch-king fall.[6]
Éowyn facing the Witch-king, by Donato Giancola
Her constitution already weakened by loneliness and despair, combined with physical injuries, Éowyn then succumbed to the Black Breath. Théoden, not knowing that she was nearby, told Merry with his dying words that she had been ""dearer than daughter"" to him. Seeing her lying apparently dead on the battlefield caused her brother Éomer to go temporarily mad, and charge in fury at the enemy. But during the battle she was found by Prince Imrahil, who noticed that she was still alive, though barely, and ordered her taken to the Houses of Healing. There she was healed there by Aragorn, the cure of the plant Athelas, and the entreaties of her distraught brother.[7]
Éowyn at the Houses of Healing
Éowyn remained behind in Minas Tirith while the Army of the West marched toward the Black Gate, to challenge Sauron. She met and fell in love with Faramir, who had likewise been injured before the battle. After the War of the Ring had ended, she decided to give up dreams of glory in battle and devote her life to peace and a happy marriage.[7]
Later years
At Éowyn's insistence, Merry was made a Knight of the Riddermark. He attended Théoden's funeral and Éomer's coronation as King of Rohan, where Éowyn presented Merry with a parting gift: the Horn of Rohan, a small silver horn taken from the hoard of Scatha, the dragon.
Faramir and Éowyn settled in Ithilien, where they had at least one son, Elboron, and their grandson was Barahir, who wrote The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen in the Fourth Age. The date of Éowyn's death is nowhere recorded.

This was a lineage of lesser status than that of the royal house, entailing a shorter lifespan. She and her parents lived in the Númenórean region of Emerië, which she loved dearly.
She was in love with Aldarion for a long while but was reluctant to marry him because of his love of the sea and did not like the time he spent on frequent and long voyages. His commitments to the Guild of Venturers and of their tendency to cut down trees also was of concern to her. They were betrothed in SA 858 and King Meneldur granted her land and built for her a White House in Emerië, as a betrothal gift. They were finally married in SA 870 and had one child in the spring of SA 873, a daughter they named Ancalimë, the future Tar-Ancalimë who was the first of the Ruling Queens of Númenor. It seemed to Erendis that Aldarion was always distant from her, and that she had too little time with him between his voyages. Aldarion often returned late, and eventually this caused Erendis to suffer. Finally, Erendis grew estranged from her husband as a result of this unhappiness with him.
She took her daughter to be raised on her farm in the countryside of Emerië. When Aldarion returned from his latest journey, he decreed that his daughter be returned from her place of dwelling to live with him in Armenelos. Erendis grudgingly did as he commanded, but out of pride she never returned to him, and they were all but divorced in SA 882. In SA 985, when she heard that Tar-Aldarion was returning from his last voyage, she apparently drowned herself in the Bay of Rómenna.[1][2]

282,TA 1883,TA 2043,Male,,,Eärnil II,Men,Gondor,Unnamed wife,"The son of Siriondil, and a great-great grandson of King Telumehtar from a cadet branch of the House of Anárion, Eärnil II was selected to become king in TA 1945 after his predecessor, King Ondoher and his heirs, Artamir and Faramir, were slain in battle.
In the previous year a two-pronged attack had been launched upon Gondor by the Haradrim and the Wainriders. In response, King Ondoher led the main army north to counter the Easterling invasion, but was ambushed before the Black Gate, defeated and killed. Eärnil was commander of Gondor's southern army and guarded Ithilien. Eärnil led his army into Southern Ithilien where he won a great victory over the Haradrim and Variags. This enabled him to turn his attention to the invading Wainriders. The Wainriders, certain of victory, were celebrating their success before entering Minas Anor. They were unaware of Eärnil's victory in the south and were taken by surprise when Eärnil, having linked up with elements of the retreating Northern Army, suddenly attacked them. As a result Eärnil overwhelmed and destroyed them in the Battle of the Camp.
After the threat was eliminated Gondor's attention shifted towards Steward Pelendur and the Council of Gondor, for King Ondoher along with his two sons were slain at the Black Gate. Both Eärnil and Prince Arvedui of Arthedain (successor state of Arnor) claimed the throne. Arvedui based his claim on that he was the direct descendant of Isildur (second High King of Arnor and Gondor and founder of the realm), and as the husband of Fíriel, only surviving child of King Ondoher. The claim was rejected and Eärnil of the House of Anárion was elected king for his deeds, heritage, and because Pelendur claimed that ""The crown and royalty of Gondor belongs solely to the heirs of Meneldil, son of Anárion, to whom Isildur relinquished this realm. In Gondor, this heritage is reckoned through the sons only; and we have not heard that the law is otherwise in Arnor"". He reigned as Eärnil II.
Aside from being a gifted general Eärnil also was a wise ruler. He sent messages to Arvedui announcing that he received the crown of Gondor, according to the laws and the needs of the South-Kingdom, ""but I do not forget the royalty of Arnor, nor deny our kinship, nor wish that the realms of Elendil be estranged. I will send to your aid when you have need, so far as I am able."" And at last in the autumn of 1973, messages came to Gondor that Arthedain was in great peril, and that the Witch-king of Angmar was preparing a final stroke against it. Then Eärnil sent his son Eärnur north with a fleet, as swiftly as he could, and with as great a strength as he could spare to aid Arvedui (now King). Eärnur arrived too late to save Arthedain and Arvedui who had fled north (and was drowned in the Icebay of Forochel) but managed to defeat the Kingdom of Angmar in the Battle of Fornost with the help of Círdan, the Lord of the Grey Havens and Glorfindel with a force from Rivendell. There, Eärnur earned the hatred of the Witch-king.
However, Eärnil was not able to withstand the takeover of Minas Ithil by the Nazgûl. Minas Anor was subsequently renamed Minas Tirith (Tower of Guard) and Minas Ithil became Minas Morgul (Tower of Sorcery).
Eärnil died in TA 2043 after a rule of ninety-eight years and was succeeded by his son Eärnur, who was as good a general as his father but lacked his wisdom, and who would be the last King before Aragorn reclaimed his throne after a long gap.[2] For the duration of the rule of the Stewards of Gondor, the silver crown of Gondor rested in the lap of King Eärnil.",

His greatest victory was against Angmar in TA 1975 in the Battle of Fornost, in which he defeated the Witch-king of Angmar, whom he intended to slay had his steed not panicked in terror of the Witch-king's darkness. It was to him that Glorfindel stated his prophecy that ""not by the hand of men shall he fall"", referring to the Witch-king as he fled from defeat. After becoming King in TA 2043, he was challenged by the Witch-king, chief of the Ringwraiths, who then resided in Minas Morgul. Eärnur, being quick to anger and wrath, would have accepted his challenge had the wise Steward Mardil Voronwë not held him back, and so the first challenge went unanswered.
In TA 2050 a second challenge came, mocking Eärnur for his supposed cowardice in the face of the Witch-king at the Battle of Fornost, and Mardil was not able to stop Eärnur from accepting the challenge. After entering the gates of Minas Morgul with a small escort, Eärnur was never heard from again. His crown lay on his father's tomb in the Hallows of Minas Tirith.
The Line of Anárion was broken with Eärnur's disappearance, and the rule of Gondor passed to the Stewards, beginning with Mardil Voronwë, who had tried to restrain Eärnur from going to Minas Morgul to face the Witch-king. The Stewards were to rule ""until the King returns"", for it was then unknown whether Eärnur had been killed duelling the Witch-king or not. Eärnur had also left without naming an heir, and while many nobles in Gondor could lay some sort of claim to the kingship, no claim would be accepted by all, and no one wanted to risk a second civil war.[2]",

Of the many swords he had forged, Anguirel was one of the black swords he kept for himself, while the other great sword, Anglachel, was given to Thingol, King of Doriath, in the First Age, for allowing Eöl to dwell in Nan Elmoth.
Eöl forged a suit of armor out of galvorn to which he wore and kept. He lived in Nan Elmoth, a forest in Beleriand to which he appointed himself Lord and built a home there. He forged poisoned javelins and stayed isolated in his land for many years until the arrival of Aredhel.

Aredhel Ar-Feiniel, the sister of King Turgon, had left the gated and hidden city of Gondolin to seek freedom and find distant family and friends. Her travels led through Beleriand, and to the dark woods of Nan Elmoth, where she met Eöl, who noticed her beauty from afar. He then set enchantments with his Elven magic about her so that she could not escape the forest and found her way only to his halls. After marrying him, she stayed with him many years and bore him a son, Maeglin.
Later life & death[]
As the First Age progressed, Eöl developed a great hatred for the Ñoldor and therefore refused Aredhel and Maeglin permission to seek out their kin. While Eöl was away at a feast in Nogrod, Aredhel and Maeglin left for Gondolin, stealing Anguirel from him, and Eöl followed them. When denied permission to leave with Maeglin, he grew furious and tried to kill his son with one of his javelins. Aredhel got in the way, and it instead hit her; she died from poisoning.

The king and his people were unwilling to forgive this deed and Eöl was sentenced to death and cast over the Caragdûr, cursing Maeglin on his way down the cliff to his doom. Though most of the  Ñoldor saw this as just, Idril was disgusted with Maeglin's act of kinslaying. This drove a rift between Idril and her kin and planted a seed of evil in the heart of Gondolin.[1]",

Finduilas, by Catherine Chmiel.
Faramir was born in the year TA 2983 to Denethor II and Finduilas, daughter of Adrahil of Dol Amroth.[1] The following year, his grandfather Ecthelion II died and his father, Denethor, succeeded him as the Ruling Steward of Gondor.[8]
When Faramir was five years old, Finduilas died. Her death caused Denethor to become detached from his family. The relationship between Faramir and Boromir, who was five years older, grew much closer and greater in love. Although the siblings were very similar in appearance with their dark hair and grey eyes, it was not so in personality. Boromir was defined to be the more daring one, as well as the more fearless and strong warrior. Faramir’s boldness was incorrectly judged less due to his gentle nature and love of lore and music. Despite the obvious way that Denethor favored Boromir over Faramir, and their significant differences in personality, there was never any jealousy or rivalry between the brothers. Boromir always protected and helped Faramir, and Faramir in turn greatly admired his older brother.
It was this interest that formed a friendship between Faramir and Gandalf the Grey. The youngest son of Denethor learned of what he could from Gandalf’s wisdom and mentoring. Denethor did not approve of Faramir as the ""Wizard's pupil"", for he neither trusted nor liked the Istar.[7]
Faramir's leadership, skill-in-arms, and swift but hardy judgment proved handy on the battlefield. During the War of the Ring, he was the Captain of the Rangers of Ithilien, who often skirmished with allies of Sauron in that province. Faramir valiantly defended Gondor from the Enemy, but did not enjoy fighting for its own sake.
War of the Ring[]
Defending Osgiliath[]
Faramir and Boromir at the time of the Witch-king's assault on Osgiliath
In June of 3018, Sauron's forces attacked Osgiliath under the command of the Witch-king, whose presence caused the soldiers to flee across the Anduin. When the last bridge was destroyed, Boromir and Faramir were upon it. With two others, they swam ashore and managed to drive the Orcs back from the Anduin's west shores.[9]
A fateful dream[]
The night before the assault on the city, Faramir had a prophetic dream in which a great wave covered all the land as darkness fell, with a voice out of the west speaking a riddle:
‟Seek for the Sword that was broken:
In Imladris it dwells;
There shall be counsels taken
Stronger than Morgul-spells.
There shall be shown a token
That Doom is near at hand,
For Isildur's Bane shall waken,
And the Halfling forth shall stand”
—Faramir's dream[9]
It came to Faramir twice more, and once to his brother, and the brothers described it to Denethor, who only replied saying only that Imladris was an Elvish name for Rivendell, home of Elrond. Although Faramir had wanted to go for Gondor’s sake, Boromir decided to go instead, for he heard that the way was fraught with dark and danger. He also considered himself to be a better warrior that Faramir, and therefore more likely to survive the perilous journey. Although he encountered some resistance from Denethor, who did not wish for Gondor's finest captain to leave him in those dark times, Boromir still went. Boromir traveled for nearly four months to reach Rivendell, and although he lost his horse near Tharbad, he still arrived just in time for the Council of Elrond.
Finding Boromir's body in the Anduin
On February 29, 3019 at midnight, Faramir, who was on guard duty on the western shore in Osgiliath, waded down to a boat floating down the Anduin river. To his grief, it contained the dead body of his brother which was pierced with many wounds. In it lay his sword, broken, but there was no sign of the Great Horn, which he and his father had heard distantly blowing to the North three days prior.
Discovering the One Ring[]
Faramir with Frodo and Sam in Ithilien
""But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs, Frodo son of Drogo.""
—Faramir to Frodo after guessing what the Hobbit carries[6]
During a battle with Southrons, Faramir, who had taken over his brother's position as the Captain of the White Tower, encountered the Hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, recognizing them to be the Halflings his dream spoke of. After the skirmish, Faramir questioned Frodo about his riddle and Isildur's Bane, but, realizing what he was talking about, quickly switched to the topic of Boromir's death and sought answers as to its circumstances. He then decided to take the pair to Henneth Annûn.[3]
En route, Faramir continued questioning Frodo confidentially, and based on Frodo's answers and his own intuition determined that Frodo was carrying some great evil weapon of the Dark Lord of the Enemy. But rather than take it for himself or Gondor, he assured Frodo he would never use such as weapon.
Faramir ate with Frodo and Sam, and listened to Frodo's tales of their journey up to that point, and in turn told the Hobbits of Gondor's decline. During their discussion, Sam accidentally revealed Boromir's desire for the Enemy’s Ring, Isildur's Bane. Despite the hobbits’ fears, Faramir remained true to his vow, for he was wise enough to realize that such a weapon could not be used for good. With this knowledge, he also realized the peril his brother had faced.[6]
On the very same night, Gollum was spotted fishing in the Forbidden Pool next to Henneth Annûn—an act punishable by death. However Faramir listened to Frodo’s pleas to spare Gollum’s life, and after interrogating the creature he decided that Frodo and Sam would be free in the Lands of Gondor and Gollum under Frodo's protection. Giving them provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest. At their parting, Faramir warned Frodo of Gollum's treacherous nature and that the path Gollum had proposed (Cirith Ungol) had an evil reputation of old.[4]
Siege of Gondor[]
Faramir and his company retreated to Cair Andros, an island in the River Anduin that guarded the northern approaches to Minas Tirith. After noting that the sky was now covered in complete darkness, Faramir sent his company south to reinforce the garrison at Osgiliath while he and three of his men rode to Minas Tirith directly. Along the way, they were pursued by the Nazgûl, riding Black Wings. The men, except Faramir, were unhorsed and it was the Captain, a master of both beasts and men, who was still horsed and rode back to aid the fallen. If Gandalf had not intervened, they would have surely perished.
Arriving at Minas Tirith, Faramir reported to Denethor and Gandalf of his encounter with Frodo and Sam. Denethor was angered that Faramir had not brought the Ring to Gondor, wishing that he and his brother’s places had been reversed, since Denethor believed that Boromir would have brought the Enemy’s weapon to him.
Denethor sent his remaining son to hold Western Osgiliath against the hosts of the Enemy that outnumbered their own greatly. Although Faramir disagreed with his father’s strategy, he agreed to go.
Faramir: ""Then farewell! But if I should return, think better of me!""
Denethor: ""That depends on the manner of your return.""
—Faramir and Denethor's exchange of words[7]
After a day of fighting the Witch-king's army overwhelmed the men of Gondor and won Osgiliath. Faramir drew back to the Causeway Forts, the defence of which lasted another day, with many of the defenders being wounded or killed. Faramir decided to stay with the rear guard in order to make sure that the retreat over Pelennor Fields would not turn into a rout. As the force neared Minas Tirith it was overtaken by Orcs and Haradrim and Faramir was gravely wounded by a poisonous arrow. Fortunately, Gandalf and Faramir's uncle, Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth, led a cavalry sortie that successfully covered the retreat. Imrahil bore Faramir back to Denethor, telling him that his son had done great deeds.
Faramir placed on the pyre at Denethor's command
Regretting that he had thanklessly sent his son off in needless peril without his blessing, Denethor, after looking in the palantír, believed that the Ring was captured and the end was near. Thus he ordered his servants to build a funeral pyre for him and his son. Despite the protests of the Hobbit, Peregrin Took (serving the Steward in payment of Boromir's death) that Faramir was still alive, Denethor continued with his plans and released the Hobbit from his service.[10]
Horrified, Pippin went to alert Gandalf and Beregond, one of the Tower Guards. Beregond, who loved his captain enough to abandon his post and risk his life protecting him, stopped the servants from lighting the pyre, killing several. Pippin returned with Gandalf, who intervened by taking Faramir off the pyre as Faramir moaned out to his father in his fevered dreams. Denethor took out a knife, trying to take Faramir back, but Beregond placed himself in front of Faramir. Seeing that he could not win, Denethor lit the pyre and laid himself down upon it, burning himself alive.[10]
Healing Faramir, by Anke Eissmann
Recovery and last days of the Third Age[]
Then, Faramir was laid in the Houses of Healing. His wound from the Haradrim arrow, along with weariness and grief concerning his constantly strained relationship with his father and the Black Breath of the Nazgûl (who had hunted Faramir ever since he had left Ithilien), all contributed to his near-death. After the battle, Aragorn came and revived him with athelas. When he awoke, Faramir immediately recognized Aragorn as his rightful king.[5]
Before Aragorn left to lead the soldiers to the Black Gate, he commanded the Warden of the Houses of Healing to have Faramir and Éowyn to remain resting for at least ten days. After Éowyn demanded that the Warden take her to the Steward of the City to have her released so she could ride out in battle, Faramir, whose heart was moved with pity and pierced by her beauty, told Éowyn that he too, had to heed the advice of the Warden. He fulfilled her request to have her room look east to Mordor and asked her to talk with him at times.[5]
Faramir and Éowyn walked together in the gardens nearly every day, and he learned from Merry Brandybuck of Éowyn's despair of feeling trapped, waiting on the waning of Théoden, and of Aragorn's rejection of her love.[5]
Faramir and Éowyn together looking towards Mordor
On March 25, Faramir gave Éowyn a dark blue mantle sewn with silver stars that had once belonged to his mother Finduilas, as they stood at the wall that looked towards Mordor. There, they saw a threatening darkness towering over and seeing this, Faramir told her of his dream of the Downfall of Númenor and that the darkness threatening to overtake Middle-earth reminded him of the great wave that swallowed the island. Somehow, to Faramir and the people of the city, a hope and joy welled in their hearts and he kissed Éowyn’s brow. They were later informed by an eagle that Sauron had fallen for good, and that Aragorn would return as king.[11]
Éowyn, however, still felt languished and unfulfilled. Several days after he gave her the mantle, Faramir told her that he understood that she desired to be lifted in greatness and out of the cage she had felt trapped in, and when Aragorn only gave her understanding and pity, instead of love, she had wanted to die valiantly and gloriously in battle. He told her that though he had first pitied her, he now loved her. There, Éowyn’s grief was fully healed, and no longer did she desire glory or greatness and realized that she had come to love Faramir in return.[11]
Faramir briefly served as the Ruling Steward of Gondor, and began preparing the city for the King's arrival. On the day of the King’s official coronation on May 1, Faramir surrendered his office, which was represented by the white rod of the Steward, kneeling as he did so. Aragorn however, gave the rod back, announcing that as long as his line would last, Faramir and his descendants would be Stewards of Gondor. After Faramir had asked the people of Gondor if they accepted Aragorn as their King (which they did), Faramir took the Crown of Gondor out and Aragorn was crowned King Elessar by Gandalf.
Later years[]
King Elessar appointed Faramir as the Prince of Ithilien, and Beregond to be the Captain of his guard, the White Company. As Prince of Ithilien, he and the Prince of Dol Amroth, Gondor's two highest-ranking nobles, became King Elessar's chief commanders. His duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and Orcs and cleansing the Morgul Vale of evil remnants. Faramir also fulfilled the traditional role as Steward, acting as the King’s chief counsellor as well as ruling Gondor in the King's absence.
Family portrait, by Anke Eissmann
After the funeral of Théoden, Faramir married Éowyn in Edoras.[12] After their marriage, the two settled in Emyn Arnen, where they had at least one son, named Elboron. Elboron would succeed Faramir as Steward of Gondor, Prince of Ithilien, and Lord of Emyn Arnen, after Faramir's death in FO 82.[13]  Faramir lived to be 120 years old, becoming the first Steward since Belecthor II to pass 100, as by a quirk, the blood of Númenor ran true in him.

The group was caught in an ambush of some kind, and he was mortally wounded, dying in the arms of the leader of his party, who then defended his body until help arrived.

Fengel's rule was characterized by recurring conflicts with his family and military commanders that stemmed from his gluttonous and avaricious nature. His son Thengel left Rohan because of disagreements with his father, and lived with his wife's family in Gondor instead of remaining in Rohan.
After a rule of fifty years, Fengel died in TA 2953 at the age of eighty-three, and Thengel reluctantly returned to Rohan.[1]",

Finarfin was the youngest child and third son of Finwë, High-King of the Ñoldor in Aman, with his second wife Indis of the Vanyar. His elder siblings were Findis, Fingolfin, and Írimë; his elder half-brother was the infamous Ñoldorin High-prince Fëanor, son of Finwë and his first wife Míriel. In YT 1280,[2] Finarfin married Eärwen, the daughter of Olwë, King of the Teleri, which therefore made him related to Thingol, King of Doriath, Olwë's brother. Together, they had four (or five) children: Finrod Felagund, Orodreth (according to the published The Silmarillion) Angrod, Aegnor, and an only daughter Galadriel who was the youngest child.[4]
After the death of Finwë, Finarfin was there when Fëanor gave his wrathful speech before the Ñoldor of Tirion; listening to the hasty words, he tried in vain to persuade the Ñoldor to pause and not be rash. Nevertheless he departed with his brothers for Middle-earth. He turned back when Mandos pronounced the Doom of the Ñoldor. Finarfin and his people were pardoned by the Valar,[6] and he became King of the residual Ñoldor in Aman and presumably still rules from Tirion on Túna.[1][7]

Finduilas was the daughter of Orodreth and his unnamed wife, a lady of the Northern Sindar.[3] Her date of birth and birthplace are unknown.[note 1] She was betrothed to Gwindor, who named her Faelivrin.[4][5]
In 472 of the First Age,[2] Gwindor was captured during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad by Morgoth, and when he returned in FA 490 he came with a companion who called himself Agarwaen son of Umarth (the Bloodstained, son of Ill-Fate). Unbeknownst to Finduilas, this was actually Túrin, son of Húrin. Despite her old feelings for Gwindor, Finduilas fell in love with Túrin, but Túrin refused her in respect for his friend. Gwindor realized this, and revealed Túrin's name to Finduilas and tried to let Túrin fall in love with Finduilas, since he realized Finduilas loved Túrin instead of him.[4][5]
After the failure of the Battle of Tumhalad, Glaurung and an army of Orcs sacked Nargothrond. Gwindor was slain and when Túrin returned to Nargothrond he was caught in a trance by the dragon who spoke to him of his kin in Hithlum, rendering him deaf to the cries of Finduilas as a party of Orcs dragged her past him as a captive intended for Angband.[6]
Glaurung's deceit caused Túrin to abandon Finduilas and instead go to Hithlum in search of his kin. By the time he finally went to search for Finduilas she was dead, for she had been killed when the Orcs guarding her were waylaid by the Haladin of Brethil at the Crossings of Taeglin. Before their defeat the Orcs had killed all their captives, nailing Finduilas to a tree with a spear. The people of Haladin buried her in a mound they called Haudh-en-Elleth, Mound of the Elf-maiden.[4][7][8]",

""Get thee gone, and take thy due place!"", by Jenny Dolfen
Fingolfin was born in Tirion in Valinor during the Noontide of Valinor. Neither he nor his brothers were particularly close to Fëanor; their elder half-brother had been opposed to his father remarrying, and thus he was rather scornful of them. Nonetheless, he lived in peace with his kin for many centuries. However, the peace of Valinor was brought to an end when Melkor, the most powerful of the Valar and the source of evil in Arda, was released from imprisonment. Feigning repentance and rehabilitation, Melkor's malice had in fact only festered and grown worse while imprisoned, and he sought to bring ruin upon the Elves for, as he saw it, causing his downfall. Of the three clans of Elves in Aman, only the Ñoldor welcomed him, as his knowledge was the greatest of any of the Valar. Gaining their confidence, Melkor was slowly able to spread lies and half-truths amongst them regarding the intentions of the Valar. Over time, these lies bore fruit and the Ñoldor began to openly debate remaining in Aman, and chief among the disgruntled Elves was Fëanor. One of the lies was that the sons of Indis, of which Fingolfin was the eldest, were trying to usurp Fëanor as the rightful heir of Finwë and seize the Silmarils, three magnificently beautiful gems that Fëanor had created, for themselves.
Fëanor, already not fond of his half-siblings, had little trouble believing the rumor. Fëanor hastened to Tirion and confronted Fingolfin, drawing his sword and threatening him with violence. When it became known what Fëanor had done to Fingolfin, he was called by the Valar to explain himself, and Melkor's lies were found out. However, Fëanor was held accountable for threatening Fingolfin and was banished to the fortress of Formenos in the north.[4] Around twelve years later, the two brothers reconciled at a festival in Valinor (though Fëanor did so only grudgingly). However, during this festival, Melkor and the monstrous spider Ungoliant attacked, killing the Two Trees of Valinor and darkening all of Aman. They then assaulted the fortress of Formenos, where Melkor slew Finwë and stole Fëanor's Silmarils. In his pride, grief, anger, and selfishness, Fëanor sought revenge upon Melkor (now named Morgoth), and attempted to convince the rest of the Ñoldor to assist him by convincing them that journeying to Middle-earth would bring them glories and treasures untold. However, many were either not convinced or only half convinced, and deferred to Fingolfin, who was more trusted than his brother. Fingolfin, though not particularly keen to leave Valinor, had sworn to Fëanor to uphold his place as the elder brother, and did not want to abandon his people to the decisions of his rash and selfish brother. He decided to accompany Fëanor.[5]
Life in Middle-earth[]
Fingolfin Leads the Host Across the Helcaraxë, by Ted Nasmith
As such, Fingolfin ended up becoming the leader of the second and largest of the three Ñoldor hosts to leave Tirion for Middle-earth. Fëanor led the first, and Fingolfin's brother Finarfin led the third, smallest, and most reluctant host. Most of those who journeyed with Fingolfin were, though willing to leave Tirion, in no great hurry to do so, and so it took a longer time for them to start their journey than Fëanor's host. Unfortunately, this delay caused Fingolfin to make a grievous mistake, for not long after setting out, Fëanor attempted to seize the fleet of the seafaring Teleri Elves in order to get to Middle-earth. The Teleri resisted fiercely, and the vanguard of Fingolfin's host, led by Fingon, caught up with Fëanor's during the middle of a heated battle. Seeing this, Fingon mistakenly assumed that the Teleri had attempted to waylay the Ñoldor, perhaps even at the request of the Valar. He and the vanguard joined the battle against the Teleri, and soon thereafter, the rest of Fingolfin's host joined as well. The Teleri were overcome, and the resulting slaughter became known as the Kinslaying at Alqualondë. After the battle and the theft of the ships, the Ñoldor encountered a figure, possibly Mandos himself, who proclaimed a terrible Doom upon them for the Kinslaying. Hearing this, and having not participated at all in the slaughter of the Teleri, Finarfin's host turned back and returned to Tirion.
The rest of the Ñoldor continued north, but as the journey grew more and more dangerous, many of the Ñoldor, upset about the Kinslaying and having been reluctant in the first place, began to openly curse Fëanor. In response, he and those most loyal to him departed one night on the Teleri ships. Upon reaching Middle-earth, Fëanor burned the ships. The fires were spotted by Fingolfin's host, and they knew that they were betrayed. Fingolfin's host's only route to Middle-earth was now to cross the phenomenally dangerous ices of the Helcaraxë or to return to Tirion in disgrace and suffer the punishment of the Valar for their role in the Kinslaying. But Fingolfin wished to continue to Middle-earth, in no small part to confront the brother for his monstrous betrayal. Fingolfin's host chose to cross the Helcaraxë, but lost many of its members along the way, greatly increasing the wrath and bitterness that Fingolfin and his host felt for Fëanor's host. The host of Fingolfin finally arrived in Middle-earth at the rising of the Sun (FA 1) and was assailed by an Orc army in Lammoth resulting in the death of Fingolfin's youngest child. Destroying the Orc host, Fingolfin and his army approached the doors of Angband, Morgoth's great fortress and smote upon them, but Morgoth and his servants, dismayed by the light of the new Sun, stayed hidden inside. Fingolfin and the Ñoldor then came to the northern shores of Lake Mithrim (FA 2), from which the Fëanorian part of the host had withdrawn.
With virtually all of Fingolfin's host furious over Fëanor's betrayal, a civil war would almost certainly have broken out amongst the Ñoldor had it not been for the actions of Fingolfin's son Fingon. For after the initial confrontation of Fëanor's host against Morgoth's forces, the Elves had defeated their foes with relative ease, but Fëanor in his pride and wrath had thought to come upon Morgoth himself, and had pursued the remnants of Morgoth's army with only a small vanguard. Upon reaching Angband, this vanguard encountered a few Balrogs and had quickly been slain, with Fëanor falling at the hands of Gothmog, Lord of the Balrogs. After this, Morgoth had sent a false claim of parley to the new leader of Fëanor's host; his eldest son Maedhros. Expecting treachery, both sides sent greater force than agreed upon to the negotiation site, but Morgoth's had been accompanied by Balrogs, who slew the Elven company in short order and captured Maedhros. After failing to gain concessions from the Elves by offering to release Maedhros, Morgoth chained Maedhros to a cliff by one hand and left him there. Fingon quickly learned of this and, having been a great friend of Maedhros before Fëanor's divisive actions, he sought to rescue his friend and cousin. He succeeded, and both returned to the gathered Ñoldor, who were amazed at Fingon's actions. Seeking to keep his people united, Maedhros waived all claim to kingship, and Fingolfin thus became the first High King of the Ñoldor (YS 7). They were quickly able to establish mighty kingdoms in Beleriand, and subsequent attacks by Morgoth against them were repelled completely and with relative ease. Fingolfin established the Siege of Angband after the complete victory of Dagor Aglareb, and ruled in peace and prosperity from Hithlum, by the northern shores of Lake Mithrim. On FA 20, he hosted the famous feast of Mereth Aderthad in Eithel Ivrin, which was attended by emissaries from all the Elves in Beleriand.[6] There Fingolfin retained close counsel and friendship with Maedhros.
Morgoth before Fingolfin
Combat with Morgoth and death[]
After Dagor Aglareb, occasional raids and sorties would be launched from Angband, but the Elven forces keeping watch upon the fortress were able to repel these with relative ease. As the centuries past, these attacks became fewer in number as Morgoth came to realize that the Orcs unaided were simply no match for the Elves in anything less than overwhelming numbers. Thus the Elven kingdoms experienced a golden age lasting for around four hundred and fifty years, and green grass grew even to the gates of Angband. With the power of his people waxing, Fingolfin began to toy with the idea of directly assaulting Angband, and perhaps ridding the Elves entirely of the looming threat that was Morgoth. However, the idea was never acted upon in any meaningful sense. Most of the Elven lords were effectively content with the situation as it stood, and were reluctant to begin an endevor which, even in victory, would be costly in the extreme. Ultimately it made no difference, as neither Fingolfin nor his allies yet fully comprehended the power of Morgoth, and did not understand that overthrowing him or assaulting Angband in earnest were simply beyond their capabilities.
Morgoth himself was not idle during the four hundred years of the siege, and he spent the time increasing the strength of his forces and creating new, deadlier creatures than Orcs for his armies. After reaching what he believed to be sufficient levels of soldiers, Morgoth's armies burst into Beleriand in the Dagor Bragollach. Accompanied by massive volcanic eruptions, the Orcs, Balrogs, and the dragon Glaurung completely overran the Elven defenses surrounding Angband, driving far into the south of Beleriand and slaughtering untold numbers of Elves. Fingolfin's kingdom in Hithlum managed barely to defend itself, as the mountains surrounding it provided protection against the flame and magma Morgoth had caused to spew from the Iron Mountains. However most of the other kingdoms of the Ñoldor were destroyed, and many of their allies, both Elven and Edain, were slain.
The apparent totality of the defeat caused a great rage and despair to overcome Fingolfin, and he resolved to go to Angband and challenge Morgoth himself to single combat. He mounted his horse and proceeded to ride across Anfauglith with such wrath that it was said that those who saw him mistook him for the Vala Oromë. He rode to Angband, unhindered by any of Morgoth's servants, smote upon the gates and shouted a challenge for Morgoth to face him in single combat. Morgoth, though still said to be the ""mightiest of all things in this world"", was reluctant to face Fingolfin because despite his might, he alone of the Valar knew fear. But Fingolfin's challenge was made in such an insulting manner that Morgoth could not ignore it without losing face before his captains. As such, he donned black armor, took up a great hammer, and emerged from Angband. Fingolfin drew his sword, Ringil, and the duel began. Many times Morgoth attempted to smite Fingolfin, but the Elven King managed to dodge all of Morgoth's blows, and wounded the Dark Lord seven times. But at last Fingolfin grew weary, and Morgoth bore down upon the Elven king with his gigantic shield, thrice driving Fingolfin to his knees. Fingolfin rose up and continued to fight each time, but as Mandos had foretold, no power of the Elves could defeat Morgoth, a Vala. Eventually, Fingolfin stumbled backwards into one of the many pits carved by Morgoth's failed strikes, and Morgoth stepped on the Elven King's neck and killed him. However, Fingolfin's last, desperate stroke managed to cut into Morgoth's heel.[7]
After defeating him, Morgoth took Fingolfin's body and broke it, intending to feed it to his wolves. But Thorondor, the King of Eagles, swooped down upon Morgoth and with his talons slashed at Morgoth's face. As Morgoth reeled from this new assault, Thorondor retrieved Fingolfin's body and brought it to a mountaintop overlooking Gondolin. Turgon built a cairn named Sarnas Fingolfin over the remains of his father, and Fingon, in sorrow, became High King of the Ñoldor. After Fingolfin's defeat, though he had been defeated by Morgoth, the Orcs never made any type of boastful song to celebrate, nor did the Elves sing of it, for their sorrow was far too great. Morgoth walked with a limp after the duel, and the wounds he received pained him forever.[7]",
300,"YT during the ,Noontide of Valinor",FA 472,Male,Dark,,Fingon,Elves,Hithlum,,"Fingon was born in Aman, probably in Tirion where the House of Finwë was located. When the Ñoldor were resolved to return to Middle-earth, Fingon followed his father and his people, though they were drawn more to the ruling of their own realms and adventurism rather than vengeance and the recovery of the Silmarils, as Fëanor and his sons sought. He fought in the first Kinslaying but only because he, seeing Elf fighting Elf, believed that the Teleri had been told to prevent the Ñoldor from leaving Aman by force by the Valar.[3]
After Fëanor's abandonment of them, Fingon and his people were led by Fingolfin across the perilous Helcaraxë. They arrived in Middle-earth at the beginning of the First Age, and the Ñoldor witnessed the rising of the Sun.
The Children of Fingolfin
After the Dagor-nuin-Giliath and the death of Fëanor, Maedhros, Fingon's cousin and friend, was taken and hung by the wrist upon Thangorodrim. Fingon went to Thangorodrim and with the help of Thorondor, Lord of the Eagles, found Maedhros. Maedhros begged Fingon to kill him, but Fingon instead severed Maedhros's hand by the wrist, and brought him back to the Ñoldorin camp. It was this act of bravery and compassion that resolved the dispute as to whose house would rule over the Ñoldor in Middle-earth, for Maedhros renounced his claim to the High Kingship of the Ñoldor, instead ceding it to the House of Fingolfin.[4]
Fingolfin gave Fingon a domain in Dor-lómin, in the west of Hithlum, where he did good service during the Siege of Angband, defeating an Orc army that attempted to go around to the north and attack Hithlum from the west, and then later the first to fight against the dragon Glaurung when he first came forth from Angband during the Dagor Aglareb.[5]
Fingon became High King when Fingolfin died dueling with Morgoth after the Dagor Bragollach. Seven years later, Morgoth's forces invaded Hithlum, and Fingon was hard-pressed and outnumbered, but Círdan and the people of the Falas, who came up the Firth of Drengist rescued them in their ships.[note 1][6]
Fingon's final battle was the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Fingon led the attack on Angband, and the fury of his warriors nearly won the day. Unfortunately, due to Ulfang's treachery, Maedhros did not arrive until three days after he was expected. This resulted in Morgoth releasing his Balrogs and Glaurung the dragon on the already weakened Ñoldor force. When Maedhros finally arrived, hope was reborn for Fingon's army; however, Ulfang's treachery again took effect, causing Maedhros to withdraw. Fingon was then surrounded and his guards killed. He dueled Gothmog, the first and greatest Lord of Balrogs, and managed to hold his own for a while. However Lungorthin, the second and lesser Balrog Lord emerged into elven history. This Balrog restrained Fingon from behind with a flaming whip, allowing Gothmog to split Fingon's head with his infamous black axe. Thus the day ended in defeat for the Elves.[7]
His younger brother Turgon became the next rightful High King of the Ñoldor, even though his host retreated after the battle and remained secretly in Gondolin.[8]

Finrod was friendly with Turgon and the House of Fingolfin. He opposed Fëanor and the Oath when he sought to return to Middle-earth to recover the Silmarils from Morgoth, but chose not to be parted with his friends and so he followed his father and his House and the House of Fingolfin. Finrod did not fight in the Kinslaying of Alqualondë nor was he aware of it as he continued the transit through Araman. While marching up the coast, the host encountered a figure on a rock and heard the Prophecy of the North. Afterwards, Finarfin and many of his followers departed and returned to Tirion, but Finrod chose to continue onto Middle-earth with the host of Fingolfin.[3]
Finrod founded the original Minas Tirith in the Pass of Sirion. In around FA 50, he and his friend Turgon, while journeying down the river Sirion, encamped along its banks and were put to sleep by Ulmo. While asleep, Ulmo revealed to them the hidden caves of Nargothrond and the Vale of Tumladen. Finrod discovered the system of caves beneath the Taur-en-Faroth, and with the help from the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains he started to build the city of Nargothrond and went on to found his own kingdom there.[4][5] Finrod rewarded the Dwarves with many jewels from Valinor. And in that time they made for him the Nauglamír and gave him the honorific Felagund meaning  ""Hewer of Caves"".
Finrod after crossing the Helcaraxë, by Maureval
While hunting in the lands of Thargelion in East Beleriand, Finrod was first of the Ñoldor to come across Men. He stayed with them long, learning their language and teaching them Sindarin. He also intervened on behalf of the Laiquendi of Ossiriand, who feared Men would destroy their home, and he received the permission of King Thingol, who held overlordship over all Beleriand, to guide the Men to Estolad.[6]
Finrod had a close friendship with Andreth of the House of Bëor, whom he often visited during the Siege of Angband to converse with her on the matters of Elves and Men. One such conversation was written down and later known as Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth.
During the Dagor Bragollach, Barahir of the House of Bëor saved Finrod's life, and in friendship Finrod gave him his ring.[7] This ring was later known as the Ring of Barahir and was eventually handed down to Aragorn when told of his true identity. Years after the Dagor Bragollach, Barahir's son Beren came to Nargothrond seeking help, and Finrod went with him on the Quest for the Silmaril to repay his debt, laying down his kingship. Celegorm and Curufin, who were living in Nargothrond at the time, persuaded (using fear of Morgoth, and barely veiled threats related to their Oath) most of Nargothrond to stay behind; only ten warriors, headed by one, Edrahil, were faithful and accompanied their King.[8]

Though disguised by the arts of Finrod, the twelve were captured by Sauron and taken to Tol-in-Gaurhoth, formerly Minas Tirith, the castle Felagund himself had built. Finrod and Sauron battled with songs of power but despite a great display of skill and power by the Elven prince, Sauron eventually caught him in a devious trap and prevailed. But Sauron could not discern who exactly they were, even though they were revealed to him. Sauron imprisoned them, seeking to learn their errand and identities, sending a werewolf to devour them one by one until they revealed their secret, yet none did. Sauron however perceived that Finrod was a High Elven Lord of great power, and purposed to save him for last. Eventually, when the wolf came for Beren, Finrod burst his chains and killed the wolf barehanded but was mortally wounded himself.[8]

Finrod loved Amarië, a Vanyarin Elf, who did not follow him to Middle-earth. For this, though she and Finrod were betrothed, Finrod never married while in Middle-earth.[9] It is noted in the Lay of Lúthien that Finrod was soon allowed to return to life in Valinor and ""now dwells with Amarië"" and was described as walking ""with Finarfin his father beneath the trees in Eldamar"".[8] Even though Mandos foretold that any of the exiles who died would never be allowed to leave his halls, Finrod alone was allowed to reembody in Valinor.
""...They buried the body of Felagund upon the hill-top of his own isle, and it was clean again; and the green grave of Finrod Finarfin's son, fairest of all the princes of the Elves, remained inviolate, until the land was changed and broken, and foundered under destroying seas.

The Elves, however, were suspicious of this call and were afraid. Oromë chose ambassadors from the three Elven kindreds—the Vanyar, Ñoldor, and Teleri—to return with him to Valinor. They would, in turn, report what they had seen to their kin. One of these ambassadors was Finwë, who, along with Ingwë and Elwë, went to the Blessed Realm with Oromë. When they returned, they were able to convince the Elves to go on the Great Journey into the far west.
There was great friendship between Finwë of the Ñoldor and Elwë of the Teleri. Then each became leaders of their own Elven-kindred. Thus, Finwë became the Lord of the Ñoldor who led his people on the Great Journey. And eventually, Finwë and the Ñoldor arrived in Valinor directly behind the Vanyar. There he and his people settled and Finwë thus became the First High King of the Ñoldor.
Finwë near his wife Míriel Serindë, by Steamey
Finwë started a family, first marrying Míriel Serindë who had also come with her people the Ñoldor to Aman. They had a son called Fëanor, but her labors in giving birth to him drained her of most of her life, and she surrendered her soul to the Halls of Mandos shortly after bearing him. After a period of mourning, he married again. His second wife was Indis of the Vanyar. Indis bore him four children: Fingolfin, Finarfin, Findis, and Írimë.
When Melkor, now free from the Halls of Mandos, began spreading lies amongst the Ñoldor attempting to corrupt them, Finwë sought to moderate his people and lead them back to the Valar. But it was too late; the Ñoldor had already begun to envision for themselves plans and new dominions they could rule in Middle-earth and were proud. Fëanor in particular mistrusted the Valar and believed Melkor's lies. He began to hoard his treasures and would only allow his beloved father or his sons to see the Silmarils. He also began to suspect his half-brother was trying to usurp him as the favored son, and made trouble in Tirion by drawing his sword on Fingolfin. For this he was banished from the city, but Finwë loved his elder son greatly and shared his exile. They went northward and built the fortress of Formenos.
There Finwë lived with his son and his grandchildren and some of the rest of his house. Later, when Fëanor was summoned to Valmar to make peace with Fingolfin, Finwë did not go out of bitterness over the exile of his son; nor did he wish to meet the rest of his people because he no longer felt like their king. Thus he was slain in Formenos when Melkor, seeking the Silmarils, attacked it. This act was the catalyst that led to the Revolt of the Ñoldor.[3][4]",

King Folcwine desired to lead his men personally but was counselled not to do so, instead command of the Éoherë of Rohan was entrusted to his elder twin sons Prince Folcred and Prince Fastred and although the allied forces of Rohan and Gondor were victorious at the Battle of the Crossings of Poros, the price paid by Rohan was great, as both Folcred and Fastred were slain.

He fell away from the ways of the Edain, but was still wise and sometimes generous. After he joined the Gaurwaith, he became their captain. However, as a result of loosing ten men to the various hardships and affrays that occurred during his leadership, Forweg appointed scouts to watch the area around them at all times.[1]
In the year 484 of the First Age, Forweg's scouts caught and trailed Neithan after he entered their territory in the Forest of Brethil. Soon, Forweg had Neithan surrounded in ""a glade besides a stream"" by his armed Men. Initially, Forweg intended kill him or ransom him if possible, but after Neithan killed a luckless man who shot before the command could be given, Forweg allowed Neithan to take his place so long as he abided his commands better.[1]
Throughout the rest of that year, Forweg, like the rest of the Gaurwaith, came to trust Neithan and praise him for his strength and skill. Yet, Forweg also feared him for his strange, impulsive anger.[1]
Sometime during the next Spring, Forweg and Andróg had disappeared without Neithan's knowledge, and the others laughed when he asked about them. Weary of the outlaws' squalid camp, Neithan wandered far from it into the woods. Suddenly, he heard cries of a woman being chased through a hazel-thicket nearby. When her first pursuer emerged from the thicket, Neithan hewed him down, killing him, seeing as his blow struck that it was Forweg. Initially, Neithan assumed that he and Andróg were helping the woman flee Orcs, but soon discovered that they had intended to do her harm. As such, Neithan threatened Andróg to leave her alone or die like Forweg. As Andróg buried Forweg and claimed his weapons, Neithan returned to the camp to inform the others of his death. Ulrad questioned how Neithan knew of Forweg's death, while Andróg assumed that he had a grudge against Forweg. Neithan gave the Gaurwaith an ultimatum: allow him to be their new captain, or permit him to leave them.[1]

Fëanor, by Luis F. Bejarano
Fëanor was born during the Years of the Trees in Valinor to Finwë and Míriel. He drew so much of Míriel's life energy when he was born that she grew weary of living and her spirit voluntarily left her body, leaving her family for the Halls of Mandos. After a time, Finwë remarried and had four more children; Fëanor's half-brothers Fingolfin and Finarfin, and half-sisters Findis and Irimë. Though he loved his father as dearly as a son could, Fëanor was not fond of his stepmother Indis nor her children and so lived apart from her and his half-siblings. In his youth, he quickly discovered his outstanding talents for craftsmanship and language. In his youth, he improved upon the work of Rúmil and created the system of writing known as Tengwar, used by the Ñoldor in Middle-earth until the Third Age. He also became a student of Mahtan, a great smith who had learned his craft at the feet of Aulë himself. From Mahtan, he learned much of metallurgy, and at some point, he wedded Mahtan's daughter Nerdanel, who bore him seven sons: Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, and Amras. He spent most of his time either alone or with his sons, such that they were all completely loyal to him. In addition to his work as a craftsman, smith, and linguist, Fëanor was possessed of exceptional oratory skill, and could persuade virtually anyone through speechcraft. He also was known to have been restless, exploring as much of Aman as he could and constantly crafting new works.[2] One of these works was believed to have been the palantíri.
The making of the Silmarils[]
By far the greatest of Fëanor's crafting achievements was the creation of the Silmarils, also called the Great Jewels. To make them, Fëanor captured some of the intermingled light from the Two Trees of Valinor and by unknown means contained it, imperishable, into three large diamond-like gems. His creations garnered him great praise, and he came to prize the Silmarils above all else. As time went on however, he began to covet the gems with a greedy love, and he increasingly ignored the fact that the light which lay in the gems and gave them their beauty was not of his own making. Fëanor alternated between vainly displaying the jewels and jealously guarding them from all but his immediate family, though eventually he came to the point where they almost always remained under lock and key.[2][3]
The wiles of Morgoth[]
Fëanor, by kimberly80
After three ages of imprisonment, Melkor, mightiest of the Valar and the world's primordial source of evil, deceived his fellows with a false show of repentance. Pardoned and residing in Valinor, his malice had in fact reached hitherto unprecedented levels, and its primary target quickly became the Elves, as it had been for their sake that he had been overthrown. He found that, of the three primary groups of Elves in Valinor, the Ñoldor were the easiest to manipulate due to their thirst for his knowledge and their willingness to listen. Focusing his efforts solely on the Ñoldor, he subtly spread lies amongst them that, amongst other things, the Valar were keeping them imprisoned in Valinor so that the race of Men might inherit Middle-earth and claim the glory that could have been theirs. Although Fëanor mistrusted and feared Melkor, in his arrogance and impatience he often unwittingly repeated the lies of Melkor. Fëanor quickly became the most prominent of the rebellious Ñoldor, to the point where the other Valar, not knowing of Melkor's influence, saw him as the source of the Ñoldor's distemper.
Melkor coveted the Silmarils and hated Fëanor, but cunningly hid all semblance of his true intentions as the situation continued to deteriorate. Melkor's influence eventually came to the point where rumors began to circulate amongst some that Fëanor's half-brother Fingolfin was planning not only to usurp his place as heir to Finwë, but also to seize the Silmarils for himself. In his pride and vanity, Fëanor took little convincing, and his hostility grew to the point to where he threatened Fingolfin with violence. The Valar, having been patient with Fëanor's rabble-rousing until that point, could not ignore the transgression of breaking the peace of Valinor. Fëanor was immediately summoned to the Ring of Doom to explain himself. Fëanor's testimony revealed the malice of Melkor and his lies, and Tulkas immediately left the Ring to apprehend him again. Despite Melkor having been the true root of the Ñoldor's unrest, Fëanor's crime had been of his own making, and for this the Valar exiled him for twelve years' time from Tirion. Fëanor went to the stronghold of Formenos and took a substantial treasure with him, including the Silmarils, which he put in a locked box. In a show of support for his eldest son, Finwë also withdrew to Formenos and renounced the kingship so long as Fëanor remained in exile.
""Get thee gone, and take thy due place!"" (by Jenny Dolfen)
Sometime later, Melkor unexpectedly appeared at Formenos where he tried to sway Fëanor to his side, proclaiming that the Valar had treated him unjustly. However, Fëanor realized that Melkor's true goal was to obtain the Silmarils, and he vehemently dismissed the fallen Vala. Melkor left in a rage and fled from Valinor. Though Fëanor thought little of the incident, Finwë was filled with foreboding and reported Melkor's visit to the Valar immediately. However, they were unable to find so much as a trace of him, and after a time the Valar were forced to give up the search. Seven years later, the Valar announced a great feast at Valinor with the intention of repairing their relationship with the Ñoldor. Fëanor's exile was temporarily rescinded, and both he and Fingolfin were invited to attend. Though the Valar had intended for Finwë to come as well, he refused the invitation of the Valar due to Fëanor's continued exile and remained at Formenos. During the reconciliatory feast, Fingolfin extended a hand to his half-brother and openly recognized Fëanor's place as the eldest, but it was returned by Fëanor somewhat grudgingly.[2][3]
Theft of the Silmarils[]
Fëanor wearing the Silmarils, by Baran Yenileyen
Meanwhile, Melkor stole away to Avathar in the south of Aman. There he discovered the evil spider-like creature Ungoliant and secured her as an ally, promising to sate her unrelenting hunger in return for her aid. During the festivities at which Fëanor and Fingolfin had reconciled, Melkor and Ungoliant destroyed the Two Trees and plunged Valinor into complete darkness. Melkor and Ungoliant then went to Formenos, where Melkor slew Finwë and ransacked the vault, taking the Silmarils and many other treasures. They then escaped by crossing the Helcaraxë, or Grinding Ice, in the north to Beleriand in Middle-earth. Though the Valar attempted pursuit, it was ultimately in vain, for the Unlight of Ungoliant completely obscured the sight of the pursuers.
The Valar quickly realized that with the Trees dead, their light survived only in the Silmarils. To restore the Trees and foil Melkor's malice, Yavanna asked Fëanor to give up the Silmarils so that they could be broken, and the light within them released. But Fëanor emphatically stated that he would not give up his Silmarils of his own free will, and proclaimed that if the Valar forced him to do so that they would be no better than Melkor. Ultimately, Fëanor's selfishness made little difference save to further darken his own heart, for a messenger from Formenos then arrived to deliver the news of Finwë's death and the theft of the Silmarils by Melkor.[4]
The Flight of the Ñoldor[]
Fëanor and his sons swear the Oath of Fëanor
Fëanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of his prized Silmarils, named Melkor ""Morgoth"", or ""Black Foe of the World"" (literally ""Black Enemy""). Consumed by rage and despair, he fled the Ring of Doom. His grief quickly turned to bitterness against the Valar themselves, and he cursed the summons which had brought him away from his father. For in his despair, he believed that had he been present at Formenos when Morgoth had come, he could have saved his father. Realistically of course the summons had saved Fëanor, for though Fëanor was mighty amongst his people, he was, ultimately, merely an Elf. Indeed, Morgoth had planned on killing both father and son during his break-in at Formenos, for he had possessed no prior knowledge of the Valar's festival and had assumed both would be present.
Fëanor as King, by Venlian
Now King of the Ñoldor after the death of his father, Fëanor returned to Tirion, ignoring the fact that he was still exiled, and gave one of the most impassioned speeches ever delivered in Arda. But due to his rage, grief, and pride, his speech was filled with many of the lies and half-truths of Morgoth. He railed against the Dark Lord, but he also blamed the Valar in part for Morgoth's deeds, claiming that they should have been able to stop him and had failed. He spoke of the fact that because Morgoth had attacked and badly marred the kingdom of the Valar without consequence to himself, there was neither bliss nor surety of safety to be found in Aman any longer. He evoked images of the kingdoms his people could build in Middle-earth, and the glory that could be theirs once they regained the Silmarils. Fëanor then swore an oath by the name of Ilúvatar himself that he would suffer none, no matter their race or reasons, to withhold a Silmaril from him, and that he would pursue with violence any who attempted it. The Oath of Fëanor was also taken by his seven sons below the tower of the Mindon Eldaliéva in the Great Square of Tirion. This oath became the cause for great tragedy for Fëanor's family, and for the Eldar in general.
His impassioned speech swayed most of those present, but even with his tremendous oratory skill, dissension quickly arose regarding who should lead the hosts to Middle-earth. For though Fëanor was now High King by birth, he was not well liked amongst the Ñoldor, and many of them were not of mind to accept his rule. Greater love was given to Fingolfin and his sons, and most of the Ñoldor desired greatly that Fingolfin and his sons should go with them and lead them. Fingolfin had little desire to go, but he had sworn to uphold his brother's rights as the eldest, and furthermore he did not wish to leave his people to the mercy of Fëanor's rash, self serving tendencies. Additionally, his son Fingon vehemently wished to undertake the journey, and urged his father to come along. Thus against his wisdom, Fingolfin would lead a second host, larger and not so eager to leave as Fëanor's, while Finarfin would command a third host, the smallest and most reluctant of the three. However even with the sons of Finwë leading the way, about a tenth of the Ñoldor chose simply to stay in Tirion, some for the love of Tirion and others for love of the Valar.[4][5]
The First Kinslaying[]
The battle in which the Ñoldor attacked the Teleri (by Ted Nasmith)
After delivering his speech and departing with his host, Fëanor's mood cooled somewhat, and he belatedly realized that he had no practical means of transporting himself and his people to Middle-earth. Though Middle-earth and Aman were connected in those days by the Helcaraxë, a treacherous and bitterly cold region of shifting arctic ice, it was deemed to be effectively impassable. Though Morgoth and the newly empowered Ungoliant had sped across it during their escape from Valinor, even Fëanor was not so rash as to believe that the Ñoldor could accomplish any similar feat. He then gave some thought to the building of ships, but knew that there were no shipwrights amongst his people and even had there been, crafting a fleet large enough to ferry all of the Ñoldor hosts to Middle-earth would have been an utterly monumental task. Fëanor therefore went to Alqualondë where the seafaring Teleri lived and attempted to persuade them to join him or failing that, to secure the use of their ships. But even Fëanor's impeccable wordcraft was for naught, as the Teleri had no desire whatsoever to leave Aman and would not be persuaded for any potential glory or adventure. Nor would they give Fëanor their ships, for they held them too dearly. Fëanor angrily cited that the Teleri owed the Ñoldor for instructing them in the arts of crafting buildings and cities. But Olwë, the lord of the Teleri, was unmoved, and in friendship he urged Fëanor not to return to Middle-earth.
The Crossing of the Helcaraxe by Ted Nasmith
But Fëanor would not take no for an answer. He understood that many of his people had been inflamed by his impassioned words and knew that haste was essential to keep cooler heads from swaying the Ñoldor to a more reasonable course. As such, he persuaded his host to aid him in taking the ships by force. This he attempted, but the Teleri resisted, casting many of the Ñoldor into the sea and thrice driving them back despite being far more lightly armed than the Ñoldor. However, Fingolfin's host, larger and less eager to undertake the journey, had been slower in departing Tirion than had Fëanor's host. Following after Fëanor, the vanguard led by Fingon came upon the battle after Fëanor's host had been pushed back for the third time. Assuming that the Teleri had been the aggressors, perhaps even on the orders of the Valar themselves, Fingolfin's host joined the battle and the Teleri were overcome. Their ships were stolen, and many of the Teleri mariners were wickedly slain. However, the Ñoldor did not escape unscathed by any means. In addition to taking significant losses during the battle, Ossë, who loved the Teleri dearly, conjured terrible storms in vengeance for them. Many of the stolen ships were wrecked in these storms, and their Ñoldor crews drowned.
A short while after the battle, as the Ñoldor neared the Helcaraxë, they encountered a shrouded figure who may well have been Mandos himself. This figure uttered a terrible Doom, exiling the Ñoldor from Valinor and foretelling that their war against Morgoth would cause them only misery. Due to their wickedness in slaughtering their kin, they would be utterly forsaken in the eyes of the Valar and would receive neither welcome nor aid from Valinor in their struggles. Additionally, Fëanor and his house were cursed, and Mandos foretold great suffering, and hardship would be their lot, due in no small part to the oath they had taken to regain the Silmarils at all costs. Above all, the figure made it explicitly clear that any war made by the Ñoldor against Morgoth would be entirely without hope; for Elves, no matter how mighty, simply did not possess the power to overcome a Vala. Upon hearing this Doom, Finarfin and his host turned back in grief, cursing Fëanor.[See Note] They had not participated in the Kinslaying and as such were pardoned by the Valar when they returned. They were gladly accepted back into Tirion by their remaining kin, whereafter Finarfin ruled as High-King of the Ñoldor in Aman.
Fëanor however defied the Doom and proceeded onward, accompanied by Fingolfin and the two remaining hosts. As such the journey northward continued, the land became ever darker, and as the Ñoldor drew ever closer to the Helcaraxë, the temperature began to precipitously drop. It was at this point that many of the Ñoldor began to openly express dissatisfaction with Fëanor's leadership. Many of them had been reluctant to accept his kingship to begin with, and now the Kinslaying and the Doom had significantly decreased their tolerance for his belligerence. Additionally, the current situation presented a number of more practical issues. Not only were many of the Ñoldor suffering terribly from the arctic cold, but it had become clear that the storms of Ossë had wrecked too many of the ships to bear all of the Ñoldor at once to Middle-earth. However, the Doom of Mandos had kindled fear of treachery in the hearts of the Ñoldor, and none were willing to be left in Aman while others crossed the sea first. Fëanor was all too aware of both the dissatisfaction of his people and the problem that lay in ferrying all of them to Middle-earth, and he sought counsel with his sons.
Fëanor watches the burning of the Teleri boats
During this meeting, it came to light that Fëanor's most loyal forces had incidentally maintained sole control of the Teleri fleet after having seized it. As such, Fëanor decided to simply abandon in Aman all those whose loyalty to him was not absolute, and he and his followers slipped away one night in the ships. They arrived at Losgar, in the land of Lammoth, in the far west of Beleriand, where Morgoth and Ungoliant had passed not long before. Upon arriving, Fëanor's eldest son Maedhros at once asked who would return upon the ships to ferry the rest of their people, but Fëanor contemptuously decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingolfin behind. This action was looked upon poorly by Maedhros, but he did not speak his mind to his father, and simply watched in stony silence as the ships burned. As the world was flat in those days, the remaining Ñoldor saw the far distant glow of the flames, and perceived that they were betrayed. Fingolfin now had the choice of either returning to Tirion in disgrace or proceeding to Middle-earth across the treacherous and deadly Helcaraxë. Fingolfin and his people chose to attempt the crossing, as many of Fingolfin's host wished to continue and many, including Fingolfin himself, were eager to confront Fëanor and his people over their betrayal. In addition, and unlike the host of Finarfin, Fingolfin's host had unwittingly participated in the Kinslaying, and they did not know how they might be judged if they were to return to the realm of the Valar. The journey across the Grinding Ice was a long and terrible one, and Fingolfin's host suffered great loss of life along the way, adding to the bitterness that the survivors felt for Fëanor and his sons.[5]
Final battle and death[]
Fëanor faces Gothmog, by CK Göksoy
Learning of the Ñoldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies from his fortress of Angband and attacked Fëanor's encampment in Mithrim. This confrontation was called the Battle under the Stars, or Dagor-nuin-Giliath, for the Sun and Moon had not yet been made. Though the Ñoldor were caught completely by surprise, they won the battle handily, for the light of Valinor was still fresh within them. But Fëanor, exhilarated by his victory and ever prideful, thought to come upon Morgoth himself and pursued the Orcs. He took with him only a small vanguard, and he and his men ventured far ahead of the main Ñoldor force. As Fëanor and his band approached the Gates of Angband, the fleeing Orcs noted the small size of the Elven force and turned and gave battle. The engagement's proximity to Angband saw a number of Balrogs emerge to aid the Orcs, and they quickly slew most of the Elves. Despite this, Fëanor was undaunted, and he long fought on alone despite being dealt many wounds. At last, however, he was stricken to the ground by Gothmog, the Lord of Balrogs.
Fortunately for Fëanor, his sons arrived with a substantial relief force. The Balrogs and the remaining Orcs returned to Angband, and Fëanor's sons took him from the battlefield. However, Fëanor knew that his wounds were mortal, and bade his sons to stop. He looked upon Angband and cursed Morgoth thrice, but gazing upon the sheer scope of Morgoth's stronghold, he understood at last the truth of Mandos's words; no force of the Ñoldor ever could or would overthrow the Dark Lord. Nevertheless, he instructed his sons to keep to their oath and avenge their father. As he died, his fiery spirit left his body and burned it to ash.
Despite being an Elf, Fëanor was never seen again in the world. His immortal spirit has never left the Halls of Mandos, and has remained there ever since it arrived. He has not been reborn into a new body to once again walk amongst the Elves or the Valar in Valinor, like the rest of the Elves could do. Whether this fact is by the will of the Valar due to his offensive deeds in the latter part of his life, or by choice has never been explained and thus remains unknown.[5]
Legacy[]
Maedhros casts himself and his Silmaril into the earth
Maglor casts his Silmaril into the sea
On Fëanor's passing, his son Maedhros became High King of the Ñoldor. Maedhros, however was a prisoner of Morgoth, but was freed by Fingon. Maedhros therefore, out of a desire to keep his people united, and an acknowledgement that, as Finwë's oldest surviving son, the kingship ought to pass to him by right of birth, renounced the throne in favor of Fingolfin. This acknowledgement had the unifying effect that Maedhros desired, and eliminated the possibility of more internal strife amongst the Ñoldor's royal Houses.[6] Fingolfin's descendants would reign over the Ñoldor until the death of Gil-galad many centuries later. Fëanor's deeds, many of which were infamously despicable, cast a shadow over the interactions between the Sindar and the returning Ñoldor. For Thingol, the King of Doriath, eventually learned of the Kinslaying, the burning of the ships at Losgar, and the curse of Mandos. As the Teleri were of Thingol's own kin, he was enraged to hear of the merciless and needless slaughter. The sons of Finarfin he came to forgive, as they were of his own kin and had not participated in the evil. Those of Fingolfin's host, who had endured the horror of crossing the Helcaraxë after Fëanor's betrayal, he held as having suffered enough hardship to redress their ills. But all those who had followed Fëanor, were of his kin, or were friends of his kin, Thingol held in contempt and would have as little to do with as he could. Fëanor's remaining sons were still bound by the Oath to recover the Silmarils, and this oath would eventually see two more Kinslayings come to pass, each more horrific than the last, and would work to undermine the Elven war against Morgoth in many important ways. Eärendil's fate was to eternally traverse the Great Ocean with the Silmaril that Beren and Lúthien had wrested from Morgoth and guard the Sun and Moon. After the War of Wrath, Maglor and his last surviving brother Maedhros stole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the Valar from Morgoth, even though initially Maglor tried to dissuade his older brother from doing this. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor and Maedhros's hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maedhros cast himself and the Silmaril he carried into a fiery chasm in the Earth. Unable to bear the suffering, Maglor cast his Silmaril into the sea. Thereafter, he wandered along the shores of the world singing laments over the loss of the Silmaril, until he faded from memory, though the circumstances and date of his death, if it ever happened at all, are unknown.

Like Fëanor, Celebrimbor would be a great smith and helped create the Doors of Durin in Khazad-dûm, which would later bear the emblem of the House of Fëanor: a single star with many rays.

They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.[2]
As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.[3]
With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil.[4] They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached Lake-town.[5] The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the river.[6]
At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.[7]
Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five Armies, and all three were later buried with honor.[8]",
323,TA 1896,,Female,,,Fíriel,Men,Arthedain,Arvedui,"Fíriel was the only daughter of King Ondoher of Gondor. She had two elder brothers, Artamir and Faramir. Fíriel was wedded to Prince Arvedui of Arthedain in TA 1940 during a time when Arvedui's father Araphant made an alliance with Ondoher. They had one son named Aranarth. The alliance came to nothing and was a failure because both of the Dúnedain Kingdoms were under attack: Arnor by Angmar under the Witch-king, and Gondor by the Wainriders from the east.
During the invasion, Ondoher was killed, along with both Artamir and Faramir, and this meant that according to the Law of Númenor, Fíriel was now the Ruling Queen of Gondor. Arvedui used this to his advantage, as well as the fact that he was a direct descendant of the High King Isildur. He used this argument to claim the crown of Gondor in an attempt to unite the two kingdoms, but this was refused by the Steward Pelendur and the Council of Gondor.
Fíriel remained with her husband in Arthedain, and when the kingdom fell to Angmar in TA 1974 after the Battle of Fornost, she probably fled with her son Aranarth to Lindon. Her son continued the Line of Isildur as first Chieftain of the Dúnedain in secret in the wilds of Eriador. Her fate afterwards was not recorded.[2][3]",

Life in Aman
Galadriel was born in Eldamar in the year 1362 of the Years of the Trees.[10] She was the fourth child of Finarfin, prince of the Ñoldor, who named her Artanis.[11] Her mother was Eärwen, princess of the Teleri, who named her Nerwen. Galadriel grew beautiful and tall, even for the women of the Ñoldor. Being strong of body, will, and mind, she was ""a match for both the loremasters and the athletes of the Eldar in the days of their youth"".[12]
""Galadriel"" by Marya Filatova
Indeed, ""she was then of Amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats"". This custom was the origin of her Sindarin name Galadriel,[13] which was given to, and accepted by, her much later in Beleriand.[14] The gleaming of her hair was not a mere poetic reference: her hair was held to be an unmatched marvel. It mingled and surpassed the gold hair of her father and the starlike silver of her mother, so the Eldar said that both lights of the Two Trees of Valinor were captured in her tresses. It was also said that this first gave the idea to her uncle Fëanor of capturing the merged light of the Trees, which would result in the making of the Silmarils. He once asked her three times for one of her tresses, but she always refused. Fëanor and Galadriel were always unfriends, both being the greatest Eldar in Valinor; and if Fëanor was greater than she, she was wiser, and her wisdom grew with the long years. For she also had an outstanding gift to see into the minds of others, and, though she judged most with kindness, she hated and feared the darkness in Fëanor, not perceiving that the shadow of the same evil had fallen upon the minds of all the Ñoldor, including her own.[12]
There was still bliss in Valinor when she was born, but soon she was influenced by the unrest of the Ñoldor and afterwards lost her inner peace. She was proud, like most of the House of Finwë, and like her closest brother Finrod, ""she had dreams of far lands and dominions that might be her own to order as she would without tutelage"". But deep in herself, she had the noble spirit of the Vanyar, which did not allow her to forget the reverence for the Valar.[12]
During the rebellion of Fëanor and the beginning of the Long Night, Galadriel was the only woman of the Ñoldor who stood among the rising princes. Though she swore no oath, the words of Fëanor concerning Middle-earth still kindled a desire in her heart, as she was eager to see those wide unguarded lands and rule a realm of her own.[15] Like the rest of the House of Finarfin, she was also supportive of the Exile by the desire to aid their Sindarin relatives in Middle-earth.[12]

Galadriel witnessing the kinslaying at Alqualondë, by Elena Kukanova
Even though she was one of the leaders in this revolt,[16] during the troubles that followed she fought fiercely against Fëanor by defending her mother's kin during the Kinslaying at Alqualondë and the rape of the ships. Afterwards, she even desired to follow Fëanor to disturb him in all the ways that she could, but nothing could have moved her to return since she had begun her way to exile, as her pride was strong then as it was thereafter.[12] She kept moving forward even under the Doom of Mandos, when her father Finarfin abandoned the march and returned to Valinor, and even when Fëanor left behind the hosts of Fingolfin and the children of Finarfin. Then she, along with Finrod and Fingolfin and his sons, led her people far into the bitter North and crossed the terrors of the Helcaraxë. After many losses, they arrived on the northern shores of the Outer Lands.[15]
Arrival to Middle-earth
Once in Beleriand, those of the House of Finarfin were eager to enter Menegroth in Doriath, but King Elu Thingol received the Ñoldor coldly, and only allowed entrance to those invited by him after some inquiries.[17] Finally in the year 52 of the First Age,[18] Finrod and Galadriel became long guests in Doriath, but her brother eventually departed to the caverns of Narog to establish the stronghold of Nargothrond. Galadriel did not go with him, and remained in Doriath with Celeborn, a kinsman of Thingol, as there was great love between them.[19] Despite their love, they did not marry each other, following the custom among the Eldar of avoiding marriage and child-bearing during the war,[20] but they were eventually betrothed till the war ended.[21] Meanwhile, she dwelt with Queen Melian, from whom she learned much of the wisdom of Middle-earth.[17]
""Artanis and Fëanor"" by TolmanCotton on DeviantArt
The Western Corn necessary to make lembas had been lost in Beleriand until the Ñoldor brought new grain back, and it flourished by the grace of the Valar. Galadriel was one of the main inheritors of it and of the art of the making of lembas.[22] It is safe to assume Melian benefited from this.
Years passed in Doriath, and Galadriel became dear to Melian, and they spoke often to one another about Valinor. Melian was eager to learn the causes of the Exile of the Ñoldor, but Galadriel would tell her nothing of what occurred after the death of the Trees. In the year 66,[23] Melian asked her directly about this, and Galadriel revealed the story of the Silmarils and how the Ñoldor fled from Aman against the will of the Valar, though she still left out the Oath of Fëanor, the Kinslaying, and the burning of the Telerian ships at Losgar. Melian was able to discern a darkness that was left unsaid, but Galadriel refused to tell her more. Thus, Thingol became concerned regarding the Ñoldor, and he was informed soon afterwards of the Ñoldor's dark deeds in Aman, and it chanced that the children of Finarfin were visiting Galadriel in Doriath. Egged on by his accusing words, Angrod told him everything, and Galadriel's brothers departed heavy-hearted.[19]
Despite all this, Galadriel stayed in Doriath until the year 102,[24] when the kingdom of Nargothrond was finished and a feast was held for all the children of Finarfin. She dwelt there for a while. During this time, she asked Finrod why he remained unmarried. Her brother answered with dark foresight about his kingdom.[19] Back in Doriath, in the year 420,[25] Galadriel heard another foretelling, as Melian told her about a Man who shall cross into Doriath moved by a doom greater than the Girdle of Melian.[26]
Galadriel did not have any significant role in the general course of events in the War of the Great Jewels, but she might have been well informed of the deaths of her brothers Angrod and Aegnor during the Dagor Bragollach; and of Finrod's, while he was held in captivity by Sauron in the year 465.[27] At some point before the Fall of Nargothrond in the year 495,[28] she and Celeborn passed over the mountains[9] to Eriador, far from the turmoil of the last years of the First Age.
After the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, Eönwë, herald of Manwë, summoned the Elves of Beleriand to the West, so they were received in Tol Eressëa and under the pardon of the Valar. However, some did not wish to leave Middle-earth, such as Celeborn.[29] Being one of the chief leaders of the Ñoldorin rebellion, Galadriel was not allowed to return[30] and a ban was set upon her, to which she replied that she had no wish to do so.[16] The same pride that led her out of Aman still moved her, and she rejected the pardon of the Valar,[12] for as she had once lived in Aman itself, Eressëa seemed only a ""second best"". She was also moved by love for Celeborn, to whom she probably married around this time.[20]

Second Age
At the beginning of the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel dwelt for a time in Lindon, south of the Lune, while Gil-galad ruled in the north.[7] Both left Lindon before the years 10-20, when Gil-galad became king in that land, apparently thanks to her influence.[31] They entered Eriador and dwelt for a while around Lake Nenuial, being followed by many Ñoldor, Grey-elves and Green-elves. They were considered to be the Lord and Lady of the Eldar in Eriador.[32] Probably around the year 300, Galadriel and Celeborn had a daughter: Celebrían.[20]
Around the year 500, Sauron began to stir in Middle-earth again,[7] but his name was not known. He was, however, perceived by Galadriel, who noticed there was a controlling evil, and that it was spreading above the world, coming from the East beyond the Misty Mountains. She also thought that this ""residue of evil"" could only be fought with an alliance of all its enemies. Therefore, she and Celeborn moved eastwards and established in the realm of Eregion near Khazad-dûm. Celeborn was not fond of Dwarves, but Galadriel saw the importance of getting close to them, for she saw military interests even with them. Also, she was a Ñoldo, and therefore close to them in mind and in the passion for crafts; and in Valinor she had learned from Yavanna and Aulë, the creator of the Dwarves himself.[32]
Some Ñoldor were also interested in establishing a realm near Khazad-dûm because they knew mithril had been discovered there. Therefore, many Elven-smiths came to Eregion and created good relations with the Dwarves. Celebrimbor, a descendant of Fëanor, was the greatest of these craft-men and thus became the Lord of Eregion.[7] In 750, he was the main builder in the early construction of Ost-in-Edhil. The power of Galadriel and Celeborn also grew: thanks to the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, they had contact with the Nandorin realm of Lórinand on the other side of the Misty Mountains. Thanks to Galadriel's influence upon Lórinand, Sauron's machinations in the Vales of Anduin were fruitless.[32] Galadriel also got in contact with Númenor, having a meeting with King Aldarion when he came to the Bridge of Tharbad between the years 883-884.[33]
Galadriel, Gil-galad, and Círdan receive the Three Rings of Power
Around the year 1200, Sauron came in disguise to Eriador, but he was only welcomed in Eregion by Celebrimbor and the Elven-smiths, who were interested in his advice on craftsmanship.[32] Galadriel was not deceived, and rejected him, saying that he was not in the training of Aulë as he claimed.[34] While Sauron realized this immediately, he desired ""to placate her…with outward patience and courtesy"" for some time. All the while, without Galadriel's knowledge, Sauron influenced Celebrimbor and the Gwaith-i-Mírdain against Galadriel and Celeborn. Some time between the years 1350 and 1400, he moved them to expel Galadriel from Eregion in a coup. Thus, Galadriel and Celebrían left through Khazad-dûm to Lórinand, although Celeborn would not enter the Dwarvish realm and remained in Eregion.[32]
When Sauron made the One Ring in the year 1600, his treachery was discovered by Celebrimbor.[7] The elven-smith came to Lórinand, seeking counsel from Galadriel. They did not find the strength to destroy the Rings of Power, but she advised him to hide the Three Rings of the Elves where Sauron could not find them. Therefore he gave her Nenya, the White Ring, while the other Rings were given to other Elven lords.[32] This was done in the year 1693, the same year Sauron began the war against the Elves.[7]
With the invasion of Eriador, Eregion was destroyed and Celebrimbor was killed. Despite using torture, Sauron could not learn from him where the Elven Rings were, although he suspected that they were kept by Galadriel and Gil-galad.[32] Thanks to the military intervention of Númenor, however, Sauron was defeated in the year 1700.[7] Soon afterwards, Galadriel was affected by the Unquiet of Ulmo[35] and she decided to leave Lórinand to dwell beside the sea.[32] As one of the High-elves, her yearning for the sea was unavoidable, and now she became burdened with the desire to cross to the Blessed Realm, but the ban upon her impeded it.[16] Thus she did not go to the sea yet, but crossed west of the mountains through Khazad-dûm with Celebrían. Seeking Celeborn, they travelled to Imladris, a refuge created by Elrond during the war. Once there, a Council was held, in which it was decided that Imladris would be the Elvish stronghold in the East, rather than the desolate Eregion.[32]
Galadriel, Celeborn, and Celebrían dwelt for a long time in Imladris, but at some point they left and moved to Belfalas near the sea at the place later known as Dol Amroth. There were a few inhabitants there, but they were visited by Nandorin parties.[32] Apparently, they returned to Lórien twice before the Last Alliance and the end of the Second Age,[36] but their whereabouts during the final millennia of that Age is untold.
Third Age
Rule in Lórien
In the year 109 of the early Third Age, Galadriel and Celeborn's daughter Celebrían wedded Elrond the Half-elven.[8] The did not stay at first with her, however, for Galadriel was filled with foreboding, and was concerned about the growing shadow in Mirkwood and Dol Guldur. Therefore she and Celeborn made long journeys investigating Rhovanion, going from Gondor and the borders of Mordor to Thranduil in Northern Mirkwood. They also stayed a long time in Lórien with king Amroth, for Galadriel saw with her wisdom that this prosperous realm could be a stronghold against the growing Shadow, if it had better rule.[36] At this point, the Order of Wizards arrived in Middle-earth, and only Galadriel, Elrond, and Círdan knew where they came from.[6] Around the year 1100, the Wise, including Galadriel as one the chief Eldar, were well aware of the evil dwelling in Dol Guldur, but thought it was one of the Nazgûl.[8]
After their enquiries, Galadriel and Celeborn passed over the mountains to Imladris, and there dwelt for many years with their kin.[36]
Between the years 1980 and 1981, a terror appeared in Khazad-dûm and the Dwarves abandoned the realm, while the many Silvan Elves from Lórien had to flee south.[8] To make things worse, Amroth was lost, leaving no heir, and the Elven realm was left without a ruler. Therefore Celeborn and Galadriel went there, welcomed by the people, and took up the rule jointly, but refused to take the royal title and were called the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim instead. Saving the realm from the perils of the moment, they dwelt and ruled permanently there.[36]
As the shadow of Dol Guldur grew again, the White Council was formed in the year 2463.[8] It was summoned by Galadriel,[9] who, being a good friend of Gandalf, recommended that he be made head of the Council. But this distinction fell instead to Saruman.[6]
In the year 2510, her daughter Celebrían departed to the West after being wounded by Orcs.[8] That same year, she aided Eorl and his riders in the Battle of the Field of Celebrant by creating a white mist that drove out the shadows from Dol Guldur, unintentionally causing their descendants to regard her and the Golden Wood with fear.[37]
The White Council would not take action until Gandalf discovered that the shadow growing in Dol Guldur was Sauron. After deliberating, the Council joined forces and drove Sauron out of Dol Guldur in the year 2941.[8]
Some years later, Aragorn II entered Lothlórien after many travels, and was admitted by Galadriel. She bade him to change his worn-out clothes and dressed him like a proper prince. During that time, Aragorn became betrothed to her granddaughter Arwen.[38]
War of the Ring
Galadriel at her Mirror, motioning to Frodo and Sam, by Ivan Cavini
Galadriel and Celeborn were well informed about the Company of the Ring, its members, and their mission, before its coming to Lothlórien, perhaps informed by messages from Rivendell.[39] In the evening of January 17 in the year 3019, the Company arrived at Caras Galadhon.[40] Coming to the talan of the Lady and Lord, each member was greeted by name by Celeborn. Noticing that Gandalf was missing, Galadriel asked where he was, for she wished to speak with him. Hearing that they had encountered Durin's Bane and that this was in fact a Balrog from ancient times, Celeborn criticized the passing of the Company through Moria. However, Galadriel was more sympathetic, especially towards Gimli, who bowed to her in respect. Before inviting the members of the Company to rest and heal there, she looked deep into their eyes and they all felt their hearts exposed.[9]
Galadriel shows Frodo and Sam her mirror - by Ted Nasmith
A month later, on February 15,[40] Frodo Baggins the bearer of the One Ring, was walking in the evening with Samwise Gamgee when they encountered Galadriel. She led them to an enclosed garden and showed them a silver basin. Filling it with water, a mirror was formed, which allowed them to see things that were and that might come. Frodo saw the Eye of Sauron, and she explained that she knew Frodo's mind well, for Sauron also tried to look into hers. She also kept a Ring of Power. Showing him Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, she explained that its power would disappear once Frodo destroyed the One, and Lórien would fade. When Frodo offered the One Ring to her, she laughed in response, saying that she ""greatly desired"" it. However, she then began to ponder how powerful she would become with the Ring's power, and as a result, a great light from Nenya covered her overwhelming height. After the light faded and she laughed again, she told Frodo that she had passed ""the test"" and that she would ""diminish…into the West"".[9] Indeed, with this rejection of temptation and her long opposition against Sauron, the ban upon her return to Aman was finally lifted.[16]

That night, the Lord and Lady summoned the Company and spoke of their departure, which was appointed for the following morning. The next day, she sent the Fellowship off on their Quest, furnished with gifts for all the members, including lembas and Elven cloaks. Later, a farewell party was held, which the Lord and Lady attended in a swan boat; from it, Galadriel sang a song about Eldamar. After everyone ate and drank, she proceed to give specific gifts to each member.[41]
Galadriel depicted by Stephen Hickman
Among the gifts was the Elfstone, which she gave to Aragorn from Arwen ""as a token of hope"".[41] The jewel was also in part a bridal gift and a token of the future wedding of Arwen and Aragorn, done following the Noldorin custom in which the bride's mother should give to the bridegroom a jewel. Since Arwen's mother Celebrían had departed long ago, Galadriel did it in her place.[42] When Galadriel stated that she was unsure as to what to give to Gimli, she asked what he wanted. After complimenting her beauty due to being touched by her nobility and beauty, he asked for a single strand of her hair. Instead, she generously gifted him three strands, which he promised to put into an imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of his house in memory of her. Apart from the strands of hair given to Gimli and the Elfstone to Aragorn, she gave a Mallorn seed and a small box of earth from her garden to Samwise Gamgee and a belt each to Boromir, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took. To Legolas she gave a long, stout bow of the Galadhrim. And last, to Frodo, she gave a a small crystal phial specially prepared by her, which contained the light of Gil-Orestel. As the Fellowship departed, the Company saw her one last time while sailing down to the Anduin: a shining figure, all clad in white, raising her arms, and Frodo was able to hear her clearly reciting a long poem in Elvish despite the distance.[41]
Galadriel as Lady of Lórien, as seen by Ralph Damiani
The following day, a resurrected Gandalf was brought the peak of Celebdil to Lórien by Gwaihir,[40] who was sent by Galadriel. He was received in Caras Galadhon, and was healed and clothed in white. He also took and gave counsel. Before he left, Galadriel gave him some prophetic messages for Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli.[43]
The land of Lórien was not exempt from the battles of the War of the Ring: between March 11 and March 18, the Galadhrim suffered three assaults from Dol Guldur.[40] After the Downfall of Barad-dûr, Celeborn crossed the Anduin with a host and began the destruction of Dol Guldur.[44] Soon afterward, Galadriel threw down the walls of the fortress and opened its pits.[40]
Later history
Galadriel, her husband Celeborn, and Elrond about to leave for Valinor
Galadriel, Celeborn, and their company attended the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen in Minas Tirith. Soon afterward they joined the crowded funeral riding of King Théoden to Rohan. After the funerals in the Golden Hall, they continued their travel northwards with other companions and halted in Isengard. Treebeard revealed that he had freed Saruman, and regretted that he would not see Galadriel and Celeborn again. Celeborn replied that he was unsure, but Galadriel affirmed that it would be her last meeting with him, giving Treebeard some cryptic words concerning Arda Envinyanta[45]. They continued on their way and encountered Saruman, who, released by Treebeard, snapped that she had always hated him, and that he would find comfort now knowing that her realm was destroyed as well as his.[46]
Two years later, on September 22 of the year 3021,[44] Frodo and Sam encountered a Wandering Company while traveling around The Shire, and found that Elrond, Galadriel, and Bilbo Baggins were a part of it. Nenya was visible on Galadriel's finger, and she seemed to shine like the moon. Frodo decided to depart with them and the hobbits joined the company led by Elrond and Galadriel.[47] On September 29, they reached Mithlond and departed over the sea at the very end of the Third Age.[44]
Sometime later during the Fourth Age, she received Celeborn, her husband.[48] In the year 120,[49] it is said that Gimli sailed to the West alongside Legolas out of his desire to see Galadriel again. He may have been allowed thanks to her intervention.[50]

He was slain by an arrow seven years after that battle, when the Barad Eithel was besieged by Morgoth's armies.[1]",

In the autumn of TA 3018, Galdor was sent by Círdan to Rivendell on an errand. On October 25, he attended the Council of Elrond. He asked for proof from Gandalf that the Ring Frodo bore was indeed the One Ring of Sauron, and he wanted to know what Saruman's opinion was. Gandalf then told his story of learning the truth about the Ring and his imprisonment by Saruman. When Tom Bombadil was mentioned, Galdor agreed that Tom could not keep the Ring safe, and he wondered whether it could be kept safe at Rivendell or the Havens or Lothlórien or anywhere else. In addition, when the possibility of casting the Ring into the Sea was considered, Galdor warned that Sauron would closely watch the road west and the Ringwraiths would return.[1]",

He was very fond of his wine. One evening in TA 2941, Galion tempted the chief of the guards into testing some Dorwinion wine with him. As a consequence, he fell asleep with the chief of the guards. This allowed the hobbit to steal the keys and release Thorin and Company from the king's dungeon. When some Elves returned from the king's feast, they found Galion and woke him up.

Early life
Samwise during autumn, by Soni Alcorn-Hender
Sam was the youngest son of Hamfast and Bell Gamgee, being bird un TA 2980 (SR 1380). He had many brothers and sisters. A gardener by trade, Sam seemed to be a simple Hobbit of plain speech. However, his love for Elves, his gift for poetry, and his belief that the world contained greater wonders than most hobbits were aware of (all nurtured by his tutor Bilbo Baggins) set him apart from the beginning. It was Sam who first introduced (in J.R.R. Tolkien's novels) the theme of the Elves sailing from Middle-earth, a subtle foreshadowing of Bilbo and Frodo's final journey across the sea from the Grey Havens. He lived with his father, Hamfast Gamgee, known commonly as ""The Gaffer"", on Bagshot Row in the Shire, close to Bag End. He had five siblings: Hamson, Halfred, Daisy, May, and Marigold.

Quest of the Ring
As ""punishment"" for eavesdropping on Gandalf's conversation with Frodo regarding the dangers of the One Ring while trimming the grass of Bag End, Gandalf chose Sam to be Frodo's companion on his journey to Rivendell. Sam saved Frodo's life more than once during the quest to destroy the Ring, and would accompany him all the way to Mount Doom.

After leaving Bree, Sam became very close to the pony Bill. On arrival at the Doors of Durin Bill had to be set loose as he could not pass through the Mines of Moria. This caused Sam great distress. In Lothlórien Sam was given a gift by the Lady Galadriel; a small box containing soil from her garden along with a Mallorn seed.
After Shelob attacked and seemingly killed Frodo, Sam took the Ring, intending to complete the quest on his own. Because he held the Ring for a time, he was considered one of the Ring-bearers and during the time he possessed it the Ring tempted him with visions of a great garden all for himself. Being humble, Sam never gave into the treacherous visions and temptations of the Ring, and returned it when he discovered Frodo alive in the Tower of Cirith Ungol.[1] He and Bilbo were the only ones ever to have given up the Ring willingly, and only Sam surrendered it readily.
Sam admiring some flowers
When Orcs took Frodo's body, Sam overheard one of them saying that Frodo was still alive, so he followed them into the Tower of Cirith Ungol, determined to rescue Frodo. Once there he found that competing bands of Uruks and Morgul Orcs had rioted and killed one another over the possession of Frodo's Mithril coat, thus making it easier for Sam to get to Frodo and escape the tower with him.
Sam and Frodo made their way to Mount Doom, disguised as Orcs along the way. The way to Mount Doom was filled with fiery rocks and pillows of ash which made it almost impossible for the hobbits to pass. When Frodo collapsed from weakness, Sam carried him up the slopes of Mount Doom, only to be stopped by Gollum. Sam delayed Gollum while Frodo continued towards the Cracks of Doom. Sam then rushed to follow Frodo, only to see Frodo renounce the quest and claim the Ring as his own, putting it on his finger. Unbeknownst to Sam, Gollum had followed in his tracks, and attacked him from behind. In the moments while Sam was dazed, Gollum attacked Frodo, and after a brief struggle took the Ring by force by biting off Frodo's finger. Gollum began to celebrate regaining the Ring, but in doing so slipped and fell to his death in the fiery chasm below, destroying the Ring in the process.[2]
The destruction of the Ring triggered a violent upheaval of Mount Doom, but with Sam's assistance, the two hobbits escaped from Sammath Naur onto the mountainside. Though they attempted to descend, the hobbits were trapped by the issue of lava and fiery ash from the mountain. Before the fire reached them, however, Gwaihir the Lord of the Great Eagles, come at the behest of Gandalf, spotted the hobbits from afar. Landroval and Meneldor, Gwaihir's companions, rescued Sam and Frodo and flew them to the safety of Ithilien.[3]

Sam and Frodo were healed of their wounds, while still unconscious, by Aragorn upon reaching Ithilien. Sam awoke, to his surprise, to find Gandalf watching over him. Gandalf led Sam and Frodo to the Field of Cormallen, where they were met by a large crowd, who praised the hobbits in many tongues for their heroism and sacrifice. There they met also Aragorn, who revealed himself to the hobbits as the true King of Gondor and Arnor. In the following days, Frodo and Sam were reunited with the surviving members of the Fellowship, and at length, those assembled traveled to Minas Tirith for Aragorn's coronation.[3]
Some months afterwards, Sam, along with a great company including Aragorn, Gandalf, Galadriel, and the other hobbits, left Minas Tirith, traveling towards the Shire by way of Rohan, Isengard, and Rivendell. All but Gandalf left them by the time the company reached Rivendell, and from there the four hobbits returned to the Shire.[4][5] Upon reaching their native country, however, they found it to be usurped by Ruffians and unfriendly hobbits under the rule of Lotho Sackville-Baggins, who had begun the process of turning the Shire into an industrial center. Sam, Frodo, Merry, and Pippin played an instrumental role in what afterwards became known as the Scouring of the Shire, in which the Shire was freed from its ruinous occupation by Ruffians. It was also discovered that Lotho was in fact a puppet of Saruman, who had come north to play his last bit of mischief. Both met their demise in the events prior to and following the Battle of Bywater.[6]
After the War of the Ring

Following the Scouring of the Shire, Sam married Rose (Rosie) Cotton. They had thirteen children: Elanor the Fair, Frodo, Rose, Merry, Pippin, Goldilocks, Hamfast, Daisy, Primrose, Bilbo, Ruby, Robin, and Tolman. When Frodo Baggins announced that he was leaving to the Undying Lands, west of Middle-earth, he gave Sam the Red Book of Westmarch and Bag End where he and his large personal family, later called the Gardners, would live for many years.[7] After Will Whitfoot resigned his post as Mayor of Michel Delving, in SR 1427, Sam was elected Mayor of the Shire for seven consecutive seven-year terms.

Later years
After his wife died in the year 61 of the Fourth Age (SR 1482), Sam, at the age of 102, entrusted the Red Book to his daughter, Elanor, and left the Shire. It was a tradition handed down from Elanor that he went to the Grey Havens, and because he was also a Ring-bearer (albeit for a short time), he was allowed to pass over the Sea to be reunited with Frodo in the Undying Lands.[8]

As the forces of Isengard approached, Gamling and his men drove back the advance guard, then pulled back from Helm's Dike and entered the stronghold of the Hornburg. During the battle, Gamling heard Gimli's warning that Orcs had entered a culvert under the Deeping Wall and led the Men of the Westfold in a charge that drove the Orcs back.
Gamling then asked Gimli to help block up the opening with small boulders and broken stones. However, Saruman's army later breached the Deeping Wall using an explosive device. Gamling then retreated into the Deep with Gimli, where they defended the narrows before the entrance to the Glittering Caves until dawn, when Gandalf and Éomer arrived with reinforcements and the Battle of the Hornburg was won.[2]",

Before fighting broke out, Morgoth used him as bait to draw out the Elven forces. His Orcs dragged him out so that his people could see him die a horrible death. The Orcs chopped off his arms and legs and left him to die slowly of his wounds within sight of his loved ones.

Gil-galad was born in YT 1481 in Eldamar as the son of Orodreth and grandson of Angrod and Eðellos, thus tying him into the House of Finarfin.[2][3] He was still relatively young during the times of the Exile of the Ñoldor and such battles as Dagor Bragollach and Nírnaeth Arnoediad. His father ruled Minas Tirith on Tol Sirion, but shortly before its fall by the forces of Sauron, Orodreth send his wife and son to the Havens of the Falas into Círdan the Shipwright's care. Gil-galad lived there until Morgoth destroyed the Havens after the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and Gil-galad and Círdan escaped to the Isle of Balar with the rest of the Falathrim.
After the death of Turgon during the Fall of Gondolin, Gil-galad received the Kingship of the Ñoldor.[5] When the Sons of Fëanor committed the Third Kinslaying, Gil-galad received word of the sacking of the Havens of Sirion, but he and his host arrived too late to stop the Fëanorians, who fled after the battle was over. However the survivors of Sirion joined with Gil-galad and went with him to Balar, where they told him of Elrond and Elros' captivity. After the War of Wrath, the remaining Sons of Fëanor vanished out of history. Maedhros committed suicide while Maglor disappeared without a trace, leaving Elrond and Elros alone. Therefore at some point Gil-galad welcomed Elrond into his ranks as his herald, after the latter chose to be one of Elf-kind.
Second Age[]
High King of the Noldor, by MellorianJ
In year 1 of the Second Age, Gil-galad remained in Middle-earth and established a realm in Lindon, which was geographically strong and secure against enemies. At its height, his realm extended eastward as far as the Misty Mountains and the western parts of Greenwood the Great, though most of the Eldar remained in Lindon and in Elrond's refuge of Rivendell.
Gil-galad had an alliance with the Men of Westernesse, especially with Tar-Aldarion (the Mariner), the Faithful and Elendil. Gil-galad reigned as High King of the Ñoldor throughout the Second Age. During this time Gil-galad was given the seeds of mellyrn by Tar-Aldarion, King of Númenor. But the seeds wouldn't grow in his land so he gave them to Galadriel before she left Lindon. She carried these seeds for a long time, finally planting them in Lindórinand ('Golden Valley'). When they grew there it was renamed Laurelindórenan ('Land of the Valley of Singing Gold'). At some point, Gil-galad and Elrond were approached by a stranger called Annatar, who called himself the Lord of Gifts. Fair seeming were his words and offerings, but Gil-galad perceived that this Annatar was not what he seemed. Therefore he refused to have dealings with him, and sent word abroad to all the Elves that they should shun this stranger.
Gil-galad's halls, in Lindon, imagined by Ralph Damiani
However Annatar was received in Eregion, where he taught the Elves how to make the Rings of Power. But Gil-galad's distrust was proven correct, as Annatar was Sauron in disguise, and the rings were tools for his wicked plans to dominate Middle-earth. Later on, Gil-galad was entrusted by Celebrimbor with the Elven Rings Vilya (Ring of Air) and Narya (Ring of Fire), two of the Three Rings, which he passed on to his herald Elrond and his lieutenant Círdan prior to his demise in the War of the Last Alliance.[6]
Sauron invaded Eriador in great force in the War of the Elves and Sauron, destroying Eregion and laying siege to the Grey Havens. But Gil-galad was aided by the Númenóreans, then ruled by Tar-Minastir, who sent a great fleet which defeated the Dark Lord's forces. Sauron, who barely escaped with a bodyguard, returned to Mordor, where he laid low, gathering his strength, plotting vengeance against the Dúnedain. Over a thousand years later Sauron was again confronted by the Númenóreans and brought back as a prisoner to their homeland, leaving Gil-galad free to rule Middle-earth in peace. In Sauron's absence, Gil-galad's power grew to the point where Sauron was dismayed when he returned from the ruin of Númenor. Yet the survivors of Númenor, known as the The Faithful, arrived in Middle-earth and established the Realms in Exile, with Gil-galad befriending the High King Elendil and building for him the three towers on the Tower Hills. A century later when Sauron attacked Gondor, Elendil and Gil-galad took counsel as to how they should deal with him. At length they decided to gather all of their hosts and attack Sauron before he could recover his strength, forming the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.
Gil-galad at the Siege of Barad-dûr as shown in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
The two kings spent several years training and assembling their forces before meeting at Amon Sûl. Crossing the Misty Mountains they were joined by Oropher of the Greenwood, Amdír of Lórien and Durin IV of Khazad-dûm. Gil-galad's famed weapon was a spear named Aeglos - which meant ""Icicle""; none could withstand it. Joining up with the army of Gondor led by Anárion, the Army of the Last Alliance confronted Sauron's forces in the Battle of Dagorlad, a long and bloody battle which ultimately resulted in victory for the Alliance. The Elves and Men then passed through into Mordor and laid siege to Barad-dûr for seven years. Eventually Sauron emerged and Gil-galad and Elendil then duelled the Dark Lord. During their struggle, Gil-galad and Elendil inflicted enough mortal wounds on the Dark Lord to destroy his body, though they received terrible wounds in return. This sacrifice allowed Isildur to sever the Ring from the Dark Lord's hand. But Gil-galad received severe burns from ""the heat of Sauron's hand"", and so he passed on to the Halls of Mandos. He was not known to have a wife, nor any children, so the kingship of the Ñoldor ended in Middle-earth and Círdan was from then on the Lord of the Grey Havens and Lindon.[7][8]
Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
Of him the harpers sadly sing;
the last whose realm was fair and free
between the Mountains and the Sea.

His sword was long, his lance was keen.
His shining helm afar was seen;
the countless stars of heaven's field
were mirrored in his silver shield.

But long ago he rode away,
and where he dwelleth none can say;
for into darkness fell his star
in Mordor where the shadows are.

Gildor and the hobbits, by Alan Lee
Frodo stayed up late talking to Gildor about the many dangers that the Hobbits might soon face. Frodo had greeted Gildor by saying, ""Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo"" (A star shines upon the hour of our meeting) impressed with his knowledge of the ancient tongue and lore he commended Frodo and named him Elf-friend. Gildor perceived that the Enemy was seeking for Frodo, though he did not know why. He was reluctant to give Frodo any advice in Gandalf's absence.[2]
Gildor: ""That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well. But it is said: ""Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."" The choice is yours: to go or wait.""Frodo: ""And it is also said, 'Go not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes.'""

Gildor then advised Frodo to leave quickly, to take with him friends he could trust, and to flee from the Nazgûl. He also promised to send out word to Elves and others to be on the lookout for Frodo and help him on his journey.[2] Gildor was true to his word, for both Tom Bombadil and Aragorn heard of Frodo's peril from Gildor.[3] Word also reached Rivendell, and Glorfindel rode out to find Aragorn and the Hobbits as they were pursued by the Nazgûl from Weathertop.[4]

One year later, Arathorn II became Chieftain of the Dúnedain when his father was killed by Hill-trolls. Gilraen gave birth to Aragorn on March 1, 2931. In TA 2933, Arathorn was slain by an Orc arrow. Gilraen took her two-year-old son Aragorn to Rivendell where Elrond accepted the boy as a foster-son and gave him the name Estel, meaning ""Hope"".

Gilraen and Aragorn lived together at Rivendell until TA 2951, when Aragorn turned twenty and was told of his heritage by Elrond. At that time also Aragorn met Elrond's daughter Arwen and fell in love with her. Gilraen noticed a change in her son and questioned him about it. She warned Aragorn that Elrond would not easily consent to a marriage between his only daughter and a mortal Man. Gilraen feared that the line of Isildur would end, and she told Aragorn that it was his fate to wander in the Wild. She said no more to him of her fears and Aragorn left Rivendell to face many perils and hardships.
Aragorn and Arwen plighted their troth in TA 2980. A few years later, Gilraen left Rivendell and went to live alone near her people in Eriador. She did not often see her son for he continued to journey throughout Middle-earth. When Aragorn came to visit his mother, she foretold her coming death.
Gilraen died before the next spring in TA 3007. Her son Aragorn fulfilled the Rangers' lifelong goal of restoring the Kingdom of the Dúnedain when he became King of the Reunited Kingdom on May 1, 3019.[2]",

Gimli's mother (left) and young Gimli (right), as depicted in Glóin's locket in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
Born in TA 2879, Gimli was the son of Glóin and a nephew of Óin, both former companions of Bilbo Baggins. He was a descendant of Durin the Deathless, father of the first house of the Dwarven people. Gimli was descended from, but was not a member of the royal line. Through his father, Gimli was also the first cousin once removed of Balin, Lord of Moria, and his brother Dwalin, two more former companions of Bilbo. It is also stated in Unfinished Tales that Gimli was prevented from traveling with his father on the Quest of Erebor because Thorin and Company thought him too young, though Gimli, being in his sixties, considered himself ripe for adventure and was disappointed to be left behind.[1]
Involvement with the Ring
In TA 3018, an emissary from Mordor approached the King under the Mountain, Dáin II, with offers of friendship and requests for news of a Hobbit bearing a Ring, as Sauron had become aware that the name Baggins was known to the Dwarf king. Not trusting the messenger, Dáin sent Glóin and Gimli to Rivendell to seek the advice of Elrond, and to warn Bilbo that the Enemy was seeking him. As a result, they were summoned to the Council of Elrond, where Elrond believed they would find the answers to their questions and would be able to contribute. Whilst there, Glóin told Elrond of the messenger and made reference to Balin, who had entered Moria and attempted to reclaim it. However, he had not sent any word to King Dáin II for over twenty years, and Glóin was concerned. The Council ultimately chose to send Frodo Baggins to Mordor to destroy the Ring and decided that a small fellowship should go with him. Gimli volunteered to accompany the Fellowship to Mordor to destroy the One Ring.[2]
Gimli portrayed by John Rhys-Davies in the films
Donato Giancola's depiction of Gimli battling Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep
He volunteered to join the company at least in part because Legolas had volunteered and he doubted the Elf's intentions. Gimli journeyed with the Fellowship southward along the Misty Mountains. However, the Fellowship was stymied in their attempt to traverse the pass of Caradhras, and were compelled to travel under the mountain rather than go over it. While none in the Fellowship were particularly keen on passing through Moria, Gimli was at least eager to learn what may have happened to Balin. Unfortunately, whilst in Moria, Gimli discovered Balin's Tomb as well as evidence that all of the Dwarves who had attempted to retake Moria had been slain years prior; his uncle Óin had been killed by the Watcher in the Water.
After Gandalf fell with Durin's Bane from the Bridge of Khazad-dûm,[3][4] the Fellowship entered the Woods of Lothlórien, thus making Gimli the first Dwarf to enter that realm since the Balrog was awakened in Moria. However, there was some tension regarding Gimli's being in the Wood, and his Elven escorts wished to blindfold him for the journey. Gimli staunchly refused until Aragorn decided that all in the Fellowship should be blindfolded to make the Elven demand more equitable. While in Lórien, he accompanied Legolas on many walks through the woods, and the two became fast friends. When the Fellowship departed, he asked for one strand of Galadriel's hair, intending to set it inside impregnable crystal and become an heirloom of his house. While she had refused the same request from Fëanor, Galadriel generously gave him three, which would lead to his name in later years of ""Lockbearer"". When the Fellowship of the Ring fractured, Gimli accompanied Aragorn and Legolas in pursuit of Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, who had been captured by the forces of Isengard.

Eventually, the three were reunited with Gandalf and became involved in the War of the Ring. Gimli played a critical role in the defeat of the army of Isengard at the Battle of the Hornburg, where he was separated from Aragorn and Legolas and driven into the caves which he would later become lord of. He fought his way out alongside Éomer when the forces of Isengard were driven from Helm's Deep. His skill with an axe led to his winning, by one Orc, the friendly contest he and Legolas held over who could kill the most Orcs, despite starting with a disadvantage.
Gimli then accompanied Aragorn, Legolas and the Grey Company through the Paths of the Dead in an attempt to recruit the Army of the Dead. Capturing the Corsair ships and gathering many men of southern Gondor, the forces under Aragorn, including Gimli, sailed to Minas Tirith. After being victorious at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Gimli accompanied Aragorn and a mixed force from Gondor and Rohan to the Black Gate.

""To Gimli son of Glóin, give his Lady's greeting. Lockbearer, wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee. But have a care to lay thine axe to the right tree!""
—Galadriel's message to Gimli
Life after the War
After the War, Gimli led a number of Durin's Folk south to establish a new Dwarf settlement in the Glittering Caves, which were located behind Helm's Deep where Gimli was trapped during the battle, and he became the first Lord of the Glittering Caves. The Dwarves of the Glittering Caves, led by Gimli, would repair much of the physical damage that was incurred during the War of the Ring in both Gondor and Rohan. Most notably, they rebuilt Minas Tirith's Great Gate with a new one made of mithril and steel, as well as improving upon the existing layout of the entire city.
Gimli was 139 years old (born in 2879 of the Third Age) when the Fellowship of the Ring set out from Rivendell, making him 52 years older than Aragorn. The date of his death is not known, and according to the Red Book of Westmarch, he is said to have traveled with Legolas into the West, thus becoming the first Dwarf to visit the Undying Lands. Of this possibility, Tolkien wrote that it would be strange indeed, that any Dwarf should be willing to leave Middle-earth for any love, or that the Eldar should receive him, or that the Lords of the West should permit it, but that it is said that Gimli went not only because of his great friendship with Legolas but also out of desire to see again the beauty of Galadriel, and that she, being mighty among the Eldar, may have obtained this grace for him. Regardless of this, he was not seen again in Middle-earth.[5]",

First Age
Glorfindel was born in Eldamar sometime during the Noontide of Valinor, and was descended from a house of princes.[4] He followed the House of Fingolfin during the Flight of the Ñoldor, but he took no part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë.
Glorfindel, by Maureval
In exile, Glorfindel fought in the Battle of the Lammoth, as he followed the House of Fingolfin, and was in the host of Turgon at the Dagor Aglareb. After the battle he followed Turgon to Gondolin, where he was appointed as the lord of the house of the Golden Flower and one of the captains of the King. He was popular and well-loved by the Gondolindrim.
When Aredhel wished to depart Gondolin to seek the Sons of Fëanor, Turgon appointed Glorfindel, Ecthelion, and Egalmoth as her escorts. They were denied entrance to Doriath, and instead turned north where the escort lost Aredhel near Nan Dungortheb. They later returned to Gondolin without her.[5]
Along with King Turgon, Glorfindel fought in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, holding the King's flanks as they retreated towards the Pass of Sirion.[6][7]
Fall of Gondolin
In FA 510, the forces of Melkor attacked Gondolin, with the help of Maeglin's treachery. Glorfindel and the last of his followers held the Great Market from the Orcs, in pursuance of ambushing the enemies. However, they themselves were ambushed and fought until a fire-drake arrived. Glorfindel and his people cut their way out, but were pursed by the Orcs. The house of the Harp arrived to help after disobeying their deceitful lord, Salgant. The house of the Golden Flower regrouped at the Place of the Fountain and was one of the last houses to fight.[2]
Glorfindel and a Balrog, falling from Gondolin's ledge, by Eric Velhagen
Ecthelion and Glorfindel, by Jenny Dolfen
Glorfindel joined Tuor in defending the Square, until Egalmoth arrived and Ecthelion was slain during his fight with the first Lord of Balrogs, the High-Captain of Angband Gothmog. When King Turgon was also slain, the Gondolindrim escaped through Idril's secret way, with Glorfindel holding the rear manfully and lost more of his followers there.[2]
As they made their escape through Cirith Thoronath, a Balrog commanding an Orc-contingent came upon the refugees. Glorfindel leapt forward to face the demon, while his followers watched from afar. He fended himself from the Balrog's whip and claws, and successfully hewed its iron helm. At the last moment, he pierced the demon's belly and it fell backwards towards the cliff, but the Balrog grabbed Glorfindel by his hair such that he fell with it. Glorfindel's body was later borne up by Thorondor, King of the Eagles, who flew down into the abyss to rescue Glorfindel's broken body, returning it to his people who buried him high on the cliffs of the mountains that surrounded Gondolin. It was said that yellow flowers (possibly celandine) grew on his mound, despite its rocky location.[2] The fiery combat sparked the phrase ""Glorfindel against the Balrog"" among the Eldar, on occasions when a power of good was hopelessly outmatched by powers of evil.[8]
Glorfindel, by Soni Alcorn-Hender
Second Age
Return to Middle-earth
Glorfindel's spirit departed to the Halls of Mandos, where he passed a short time. Due to his noble actions that had saved many Elves in the Fall of Gondolin, he was re-embodied and dwelt in Valinor.
Many years later, in SA 1600, Manwë sent him back to Middle-earth as an emissary of the Valar and granted him powers nearly as strong as those of the Maiar.[9]
Third Age
It is possible that Glorfindel remained for a time in Lindon along with other noble Elves, such as Gil-galad, Círdan, and Elrond, a descendant of Tuor and Idril. However, by the mid-Third Age he dwelt in Rivendell.

Battle of Fornost
Do not pursue him! He will not return to this land. Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall.—Glorfindel's prophecy about the Witch-king[10]
Glorfindel returning to Middle-earth from the Blessed Lands, by Ralph Damiani
In the Battle of Fornost, Glorfindel turned the odds against the Witch-king of Angmar and his host. After the battle finished, and the Witch-king had fled, it was Glorfindel who predicted that no mortal man would ever destroy the Witch-king.[10] This prediction was fulfilled a thousand years later at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, when Éowyn of Rohan and Meriadoc Brandybuck, a hobbit, slew the Witch-king.[11]
War of the Ring
Suddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows, running swiftly. In the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed, as if it were studded with gems like living stars. The rider's cloak streamed behind him, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed.... it appeared that white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider, as if though through a thin veil.—The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I: The Fellowship of the Ring, ""Flight to the Ford""
Nearly a thousand years later in TA 3018, Glorfindel was sent by Lord Elrond to search for Frodo Baggins and his companions. He attacked some of the Nazgûl and drove them away from the Last Bridge, pursuing them for awhile. He then found and led the company for days stopping only briefly to let the Hobbits rest. When the Nazgûl approached again, Glorfindel put Frodo on his white horse Asfaloth, and bade the horse take Frodo to Rivendell. Asfaloth outran the black horses of the Nazgûl and managed to cross the Ford of Bruinen which led to Rivendell. A severely weakened Frodo, conscious but delirious due to the wound he bore from the Morgul-knife, turned back to defy the Riders who pleaded for him to come with them. The Nazgûl entered the shallow ford but were there un-horsed and swept away by a torrent of enchanted water which guarded the entrance to Imladris charged with the power of the Half-elven and indeed by Gandalf the Grey.[12] He later led the injured Frodo and the rest of the company safely to Rivendell.
At the Council of Elrond, Glorfindel sat in a position of honour alongside Elrond and Gandalf. He suggested that the One Ring should be either sent to Tom Bombadil or cast into the depths of the Sea, but Gandalf believed that the One would resurface on land after a hundred or thousand years. He was briefly considered to be a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, but was later ruled out: his power would be of no use in a mission of secrecy to Mordor.[13]
After the War
After the Ring's destruction, Glorfindel, along with Erestor and the sons of Elrond, witnessed the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen.[14] His ultimate fate is not known, but it is reasonable to assume that he eventually sailed to Valinor with the rest of his kin.

In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as ""simpletons"" and also said that Hobbits ""would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell"".
Quest for Erebor
In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to recapture it from the dragon Smaug. He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made camp. Glóin also fought in the Battle of Five Armies.[1] After the battle, he made his home in the Lonely Mountain.
War of the Ring
On October 25, 3018, Glóin and his son Gimli attended the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, where he greeted Frodo Baggins at the welcome dinner, after Frodo had recovered from his wound received from the Witch-king of Angmar. He recounted the history of the Lonely Mountain and the Kingdom of Dale since Bilbo had left, including Balin's decision to leave the Lonely Mountain and re-establish the ancient Dwarven kingdom in Moria. At the Council of Elrond, his son Gimli warned of the messengers from Mordor who had been threatening King Dáin II Ironfoot, seeking news of Bilbo, Frodo, and the One Ring.

Both of Gróin's sons undertook the Quest of Erebor, and Glóin was the father of Gimli of the Fellowship of the Ring. Gróin died in TA 2923. For all his genealogical importance, nothing more is known of his life. His dates of birth and death, though, state that he was alive at the time of Smaug's Sack of Erebor, and the War of the Dwarves and Orcs twenty-nine years later. It is likely that he was present at both these events.[1]",
374,TA 2563,TA 2805,Male,,,Grór,Dwarves,,Unnamed wife,"Grór was born in the Ered Mithrin as the youngest of three sons born to Dáin I. His older brothers were Thrór and Frór. After the death of his father in TA 2589, he and his brother left the Grey Mountains and while Thrór went back to the Lonely Mountain, Grór went further into the east and in TA 2590 he established himself as Lord of the Iron Hills.
Two hundred years later, just before the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799, he thought himself too old to go at age 237, and instead sent his son Náin and grandson Dáin. Grór died shortly after in TA 2805.[1] He was then succeeded as Lord of the Iron Hills by Dáin II, for his son had died in the Battle of Anzanulbizar.",
375,,,Male,,,Guilin,Elves,,Unnamed wife,"Though little is known about him, Guilin was the father of Gelmir and Gwindor, both of whom played major roles in the First Age. Gelmir's death initiated the Nírnaeth Arnoediad,[1] which resulted in the captivity and enslavement of Gwindor in Angband.[2]",
376,"Mid ,First Age",FA 456,Male,,,Gundor,Men,,,"Gundor was the second son of Hador Lórindol, Lord of Dor-lómin.[1] He followed his father to war in the Dagor Bragollach where they were both slain by many arrows. Their deaths were greatly mourned by the Elves.[2]

To sound the charge Théoden took a horn from Guthláf and blew it so hard it burst.
He fell with the banner in his hand, and it had to be taken from him after death to be given to Éomer. He earned himself mention in the Song of the Mounds of Mundburg.[1]",
378,"Unknown, possibly during the ,First Age",FA 495,Male,Became grey in captivity,,Gwindor,Elves,,"None, betrothed to ,Finduilas","Gwindor was credited with beginning the Nírnaeth Arnoediad when, at the sight of his brother Gelmir's brutal murder at the hands of Orcs, he rashly charged the hosts of Morgoth on the plains of Anfauglith by his own will. He was ultimately captured when Morgoth's reserves were set forth from the fortress and the armies of Men and Elves were overrun. He was enslaved and put into one of the stone-gangs of Angband for seventeen years (FA 472 -489).
Gwindor later escaped Angband, but his hand was cut off in a fight with a guard. The injury devastated Gwindor and he fell into despair in the wilderness, and nearly died of the wound. He was rescued by Beleg and his will to live returned. He later helped Beleg free Túrin and, after Beleg's tragic and accidental death, Gwindor found himself trying to rouse Túrin as Beleg had roused him. He brought Túrin to Nargothrond, and in time would counsel against Túrin's policy of open warfare against Morgoth, but was ignored. He loved the Elf Finduilas, but found himself unfit to wed her, and an engagement between them was broken. He grew jealous of Túrin since she loved him more, and felt Túrin had gained respect from the council at his expense. He warned Finduilas that Túrin was cursed and would bring doom to the people he loved. Nevertheless, Gwindor pitied and loved him.
He was mortally wounded in the Battle of Tumhalad, the last battle of Nargothrond. Túrin abandoned the battle and bore him to safety, but his wounds could not be healed. Gwindor died reproaching Túrin for his pride and pleading him to save Finduilas, who alone stood between Túrin and his doom.[2][3][4]",

381,FA 390,FA 455,Male,Golden,,Hador,Men,,Gildis,"Heraldic Device of the House of Hador
Hador was the son of Hathol and the great-great-grandson of Marach, (who first led the people of the Third House into Beleriand and was their first chieftain), and heir to the House of Marach. He entered the service of Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor, at a young age. Hador was loved by the King, and he rose high in the esteem of many of the Eldar. Eventually, Hador would even become a part of Fingolfin's own council. Realizing the need for the Edain to live under their own lords and have lands of their own, Fingolfin granted as a fief to Hador the land of Dor-lómin (land of echoes) which thus made him the first Lord of Dor-lómin. Hador gathered most of the people of the Third House into that land, which lay in Hithlum. There, Hador's people became numerous; and he encouraged the use of the Sindarin tongue.
Hador continued to win renown among the Eldar as the Lord of Dor-lómin, as well as among Men. Two of Hador's children, Galdor and Glóredhel, were wedded to two of the children of Halmir, Chieftain of the Haladin, respectively Hareth, his daughter, and Haldir, his son of the House of Haleth, when the two peoples met for a great feast. Fingolfin also gave to Hador a great helm made by Telchar of Nogrod. It was made in the likeness of the dragon Glaurung, and came to be known as the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin; it could only be borne by one of great stature and strength. In the year 455 of the First Age, Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband in the Dagor Bragollach. Hador fought alongside Fingolfin with what few warriors of the Third House he could gather against the swift onset of Morgoth's forces. He was slain, however, defending the retreat of his lord. His younger son, Gundor, fell beside him before the fortress of Barad Eithel. It was said that their deaths were greatly mourned by the Eldar.
The Dragon Helm, by Alan Lee.
Hador was the forefather of many heroes. His grandsons were Húrin and Huor. His great-grandsons were Túrin and Tuor, and his great-great grandson was Eärendil the Mariner. Aragorn Elessar, as well as all the Kings of Númenor, Gondor and Arnor were descended from Hador.[2] Perhaps the greatest testament to the legacy of Hador was that which was later written about his descendants:
""The Men of the Three Houses throve and multiplied, but greatest among them was the house of Hador Goldenhead, peer of Elven-lords. His people were of great strength and stature, ready in mind, bold and steadfast, quick to anger and to laughter, mighty among the Children of Ilúvatar in the youth of Mankind.""[citation needed]

382,TA 2245,TA 2395,Male,,,Hador (Steward),Men,,Unnamed wife,"Hador was born in TA 2245 and was the only son of his father Túrin I. Following his father's death in TA 2278 Hador became the seventh Ruling Steward of Gondor, and the seventh steward to rule during the era known as the Watchful Peace. During his time as Steward and on the three hundredth anniversary of the Steward's Reckoning, the calendar system created by Mardil Voronwë was modified by Hador, adding one day to it to make it more accurate. Hador ruled Gondor until his death in TA 2395 at the age of 150 years old after a rule of one-hundred and seventeen years. Upon his death he was succeeded by his son Barahir.
Hador was the last noble Man of Gondor to live such a long life.[3]",
383,TA 2916,"March 15 ,3019",Male,Black,Tall,Halbarad,Men,,,"Halbarad was among the Rangers who guarded the Shire in the years prior to the War of the Ring. He said of the Hobbits, ""A little people, but of great worth are the Shire-folk. Little do they know of our long labor for the safekeeping of their borders, and yet I grudge it not.""
In response to a message sent to Rivendell by Galadriel, Halbarad led the Grey Company, comprised of 30 Rangers, south to the aid of their kinsman Aragorn. Aragorn rejoiced at their coming, and Théoden remarked thus; ""It is well! If these kinsmen be in any way like yourself, my Lord Aragorn, thirty such knights will be a strength that cannot be counted by heads.""
With them also rode Elladan and Elrohir, the sons of Elrond. They caught up with Aragorn near the Fords of Isen in Rohan in the early hours of March 6, TA 3019. Halbarad brought Aragorn a message from Arwen as well as a standard made by her, which Aragorn asked Halbarad to keep for him for a while.
Halbarad accompanied Aragorn to a chamber high in the Hornburg where Aragorn looked into the palantír and revealed himself to Sauron. That morning Aragorn decided to take the Paths of the Dead, down the Dimholt Road, under the White Mountains and Halbarad and the Grey Company went with him, along with Legolas and Gimli. When they reached the entrance at daybreak on March 8, Halbarad said, ""This is an evil door, and my death lies beyond it. I will dare to pass it nonetheless...""[1]
At midnight at the Stone of Erech, Aragorn summoned the Dead to fulfil their oaths and Halbarad unfurled Aragorn's standard, which appeared black with no device in the darkness. The Grey Company and the Army of the Dead passed through the lands of the south to Pelargir, where they captured the fleet of the Corsairs. Aragorn dismissed the Dead, and the Grey Company sailed up the Anduin.[2]
When they arrived at the Pelennor Fields on March 15 in the midst of the battle, Aragorn's standard was once again unfurled but now it was seen to bear the emblems of the House of Elendil; the White Tree of Gondor surmounted by seven stars and a crown. Halbarad carried the standard onto the battlefield, where he was killed.[3]",

He married Glóredhel of the House of Hador at the same feast where Galdor married Hareth[2], and they had a son named Handir. He fostered Húrin and Huor in their childhood years.[3] Haldir marched with the rest of his kin in support of the Union of Maedhros and was slain in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad along with most of the Men of Brethil.[4] Afterwards, his son Handir then inherited the title of Chieftain of the Haladin. When Glóredhel learned of his death, she fell into grief and illness and soon died.[5]

385,,TA 3019,Male,Golden,,Haldir (Lorien),Elves,,,"Third Age[]
""The Dwarf breathed so loudly we could have shot him in the dark.""
On January 15, 3019, Haldir and fellow guards encountered the Fellowship near the Nimrodel in the eaves of the forest. Haldir was able to speak to the Fellowship, for he knew the Common Tongue. He welcomed Legolas as a distant kinsman from the north (Mirkwood), and recognized Aragorn as a friend to Lady Galadriel. He was prepared to lead the Fellowship into Lórien, but hesitated upon learning that one of the party was a Dwarf. After consulting with his brothers, Haldir agreed that Gimli could enter if he went blindfolded. The fellowship then insisted that if one of them had to go blindfolded, they all would. The brothers reluctantly agreed, and then led them into the forest.[1]
They spent the night on a flet, or a platform in the trees. During the night, Haldir and his brothers heard Orcs passing and lured them away from the Fellowship. When he returned to the flet, Haldir saw a strange creature at the base of the tree, which Frodo guessed to be Gollum.
In the morning, Haldir fashioned a rope bridge for the Fellowship to use to cross the Silverlode. Haldir learned from Merry Brandybuck that the Grey Havens lay west of the Shire, and he spoke longingly of the sea, but sadly of the time when he and his kin would have to leave Lórien. When news came that the Fellowship's blindfolds could be removed, Haldir apologized to Gimli and welcomed him as the first Dwarf to enter Lórien since the time of Durin.
After guiding the Fellowship to Caras Galadhon, Haldir returned to his duties guarding the northern borders, but he returned when the Fellowship was about to depart to guide them to the banks of the Silverlode, where boats awaited them.[1]
Nothing further is known of Haldir's activities. It is likely that he participated in the defense of Lothlórien when the forces of Dol Guldur attacked it in March of 3019.
Haldir was one of the few Elves of Lórien who could speak Westron. He had clearly heard of Aragorn, but there is no indication that they had met previously.",
386,FA 341,FA 420,Female,,,Haleth,Men,,,"At the time of her birth, the Haladin had settled in Thargelion, in East Beleriand. After her father and her twin brother Haldar were slain in an Orc raid, Haleth became leader of the House. She held her people together for seven days until Caranthir and his army drove out the Orcs and ended their siege on the Haladin. Seeing, at last, what great courage dwelt in the hearts of some Men, Caranthir did Haleth great honor by offering her people land in the north under the protection of the Eldar. However, out of pride and a desire to remain independent, she declined the generous offer and instead gathered what remained of her people after the Orc siege and led them to Estolad.
Against the desire of her people, Haleth led the Haladin even further west to the land between the Mountains of Terror and the Girdle of Melian. Suffering much hardship and loss, many regretted taking part in the journey. Eventually, Haleth led her people to the relative safety of the Forest of Brethil on the western border of Doriath where they settled for the duration of the First Age. The Haladin then became known as the House of Haleth. She remained chieftainess of the Haladin until she died and retained a picked bodyguard of women. When she died, her people raised a green mound for her in the heights of the forest - named Tûr Haretha, the Ladybarrow, or Haudh-en-Arwen in Sindarin. Having never married, the leadership of the Haladin passed on to her nephew Haldan, son of her brother Haldar.[1]",
387,"Late ,Third Age","Winter of ,TA 2758",Male,,,Haleth (Helm's son),Men,,,"Haleth was born sometime around TA 2716, during the last years of the reign of his great-grandfather King Déor, the seventh King of Rohan. He would be the eldest son of Prince Helm Hammerhand and his unnamed wife, and would later have a sister, whose name is unknown, as well as a younger brother named Háma. His father Helm was the son of Gram, son and heir apparent to the reigning King Déor. When Haleth was a baby in TA 2718 his great-grandfather King Déor, now an old man at seventy-four, died after a nineteen-year reign spent fighting the Dunlendings and was succeeded by Haleth's grandfather Gram, who became the eighth king of Rohan.
The reign of Haleth's grandfather Gram saw the continuation of hostilities with the Dunlendings that had begun under the reign of King Déor. Eventually, Gram died in TA 2741, and Helm succeeded him as ninth king of Rohan.
During the reign of Helm, the King came into conflict with a powerful Dunlending landowner called Freca, who obstinately asked Helm for his daughter's hand in marriage for his son. King Helm took exception to his request and killed Freca with his bare hands in TA 2754. This would lead to another great war when the slain Freca's son and heir Wulf took a large host of Dunlendings to invade Rohan in TA 2758. When the invaders reached Edoras later that year, Haleth was killed defending the doors of the Golden Hall. Haleth's younger brother Háma and his father Helm himself would also die later on in this conflict in TA 2759.
With the deaths of King Helm and his sons, the main branch of the House of Eorl would become extinct. Therefore, the crown was claimed by the 33 year old Fréaláf Hildeson, a maternal grandson of King Gram via his daughter Princess Hild (sister of the late King Helm) who would avenge his uncle and cousins deaths by killing Wulf in single combat. Fréaláf would begin a cadet branch that formed the second line of the Kings of Rohan that would last until the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age.[1]",
388,SA 852,SA 1211,Male,,,Hallacar,Men,,Tar-Ancalimë,"Hallacar was a descendant of the short reigning king Vardamir Nólimon. He was a royal suitor who wished to marry Ancalimë, but she rejected all those who sought her hand and went into hiding in the land of Emerië.[2] He knew that Ancalimë was there and for a time he lived there as a simple shepherd, going by the name of Mámandil. The two became very close friends and frequently met with each other in the pastures. There he sang songs to her for he was quite skilled in such things and she was pleased, but he altered his songs to lament the lovers of old in an attempt to express his love for her. Afterwards, he did declare his love for her but she did not return it and drew back. It was after this that he revealed what his true name was and his lineage. Angry at this deception, she rejected him, at least at first but eventually they did agree to wed despite the fact that she did not desire to be married.
They married in SA 1000. Their marriage seemed to be for political reasons as Ancalimë needed to produce an heir to continue the royal bloodline and to prevent her cousin Soronto, who also had a claim to the throne of Númenor from becoming king. Hallacar's life with the Queen was not a happy one but they did have a son Anárion, the future Tar-Anárion. Afterwards the two became estranged and begun living apart from each other.[1]",
389,TA 2480,TA 2605,Male,,,Hallas (Steward),Men,,Unnamed wife,"Hallas was born in TA 2480 and was the son of Cirion. When Cirion died in TA 2567, Hallas succeeded him as Ruling Steward. Calenardhon had been given by his father to the Éothéod, and Hallas grew particularly friendly with the new arrivals and devised the names Rochand and Rochirrim for the land and its people, which became Rohan and Rohirrim in the Sindarin dialect of Gondor. In effect, Gondor had been halved in size, but it had gained a strong ally to the north in return.[3]
War never ceased on Gondor's eastern borders as the Balchoth were not completely destroyed, but they were no longer a serious threat. More of a problem was the Corsairs of Umbar, who kept raiding the coasts and Orcs based in Minas Morgul.
Hallas died in TA 2605 at the age of 125 years old after thirty-eight years of rule. He was succeeded by his son Húrin II.",

He owned a large amount of pastoral land in the Númenórean province of Emerië where many sheep were herded. This farming settlement was named Hyarastorni, where Hallatan ruled as 'Sheep-lord'. He often hosted Aldarion at his home in the reign of Tar-Meneldur, and where the other shepherds of Hyarastorni were known to come to visit. He was married to an unnamed woman and their children were Hallacar and Nessanië. His son came to marry Ancalimë in TA 1000.[1]",

He was among the most famed of the Haladin, and a strong chieftain of his people. His sons were Haldir and Hundar; his daughters were Hareth and Hiril. Haldir and Hareth married into the House of Hador.
""Ambush of the Orc-Host"", by Ted Nasmith
While Halmir led the Haladin, the Forest of Brethil was largely unscathed by the forces of Morgoth. He led the Woodmen north to join the fight against Thangorodrim, and he was recognized with honor by the Elves. When large numbers of Orcs began to appear, Halmir sent for the aid of Elu Thingol of Doriath. To Halmir was sent a host of the Sindar under Beleg Cúthalion, and the combined force of the Woodmen and Sindar ambushed and destroyed an orc-legion in the depths of the forest; in this way Halmir won renown.[1] Later, when the Union of Maedhros was formed, Halmir pledged to send many men of the woods to join the muster of the Elven lords. However, Halmir died before he could lead his people to the war, and the lordship of the House of Haleth passed to Haldir, who fought in his father's stead.[2]",

He was said to be a great warrior, and served as chieftain and Lord of the Men of Brethil around the time of the Nírnaeth Arnoediad.[2] During his lordship, Orcs invaded his lands, and leading the fight against them, he was slain in battle north of the Forest of Brethil. His people were driven back into the woods.
Handir was married to Beldis of the House of Bëor and had one son, Brandir.[3]

394,FA 470,FA 501,Male,,,Hardang,Men,,,"Hardang was a descendant of Halmir of the House of Haleth. His father was Hundad, and his grandfather was Hundar. After the death of the Halbar of Brethil, Handir, Hardang tried to supersede his cousin, Brandir, in acquiring the leadership of the Men of Brethil. Many Haladin believed Brandir to be unfit to rule them, and therefore supported Hardang.
Many people wanted Brandir's cousin Manthor to assume the role of Halbar instead. Unfortunately for him and his supporters, he was related to Brandir by a daughter, which meant that his kinship with Brandir was worth less in the eyes of the people. Hardang then won the vote, and became the Halbar of the Men of Brethil in FA 499. Upon becoming Halbar, Hardang chose Manthor to be the Captain of the Guards at the Crossings of Taeglin.
Within two years of ruling Brethil, whispers of the return of Húrin began echoing throughout Brethil. Hardang harbored resentment for the House of Hador, of which Húrin was a member, as it was not his own, and many of the houses of the time had harsh rivalries. Therefore, upon Húrin's arrival, Hardang launched an attack against him. Húrin wounded Hardang in the battle, and Manthor later defended Húrin and restored his honor, which made Hardang's approval with the people suffer.
Húrin survived the conflict, and Hardang lost a great deal more public approval for the attempt on his life. A group of the citizens then banded together and burned the Hall of the Haladin, from where all the Chieftains had ruled, with the intent of killing Hardang. He tried to flee from the burning structure, but was hit in the back by a spear while running away, and perished.[2]",

When the battle was lost, he became one of the XII Bëorings who followed Barahir in Dorthonion. Hathaldir was killed along with the others at Tarn Aeluin by an Orc-force sent by Sauron to hunt them down after being betrayed by the outlaw-member Gorlim ""the Unhappy"".[1][2]",

399,"Sometime before ,SA 799",,Male,,,Hatholdir,Men,,Unnamed wife,"Hatholdir was a man descended from the House of Hador. His was a close personal friend of King Tar-Meneldur. He married an unnamed woman and had a son named Orchaldor who entered royal line through marriage with Ailinel, the oldest daughter of his father's friend.[1]",
400,TA 2691,TA 2759,Male,,,Helm Hammerhand,Men,Rohan,Unnamed wife,"Helm was born in TA 2691 to the royal House of Eorl that had ruled Rohan since TA 2510, during the reign of his great-grandfather, King Goldwine, sixth King of Rohan. Helm was the son of Prince Gram, the grandson of King Goldwine as son of Crown Prince Déor. When Helm was a young boy in TA 2699, the elderly King Goldwine died at the age of 80 after a long, peaceful reign, and the Crown Prince, aged 55, succeeded him as seventh King of Rohan. With King Déor's ascension, Helm's father Gram become the new Crown Prince, while Helm himself became second in line to the throne as grandson of the reigning monarch.
Unlike the reign of Helm's great-grandfather, King Goldwine, that Helm had spent his early childhood under, the reign of Déor was marked by conflict with the Dunlendings, a race of wild men inhabiting the lands bordering Rohan. Eleven years into King Déor's reign in TA 2710, by which time his grandson Prince Helm had grown to manhood, the Dunlendings would successfully capture the Gondorian fortress of Isengard, which they would use in succeeding years as a base. King Déor would die in TA 2718 at the old age of 74 after 19 years on the throne, and his 50-year-old son Crown Prince Gram, Helm's father, would succeed him as the Eighth King of Rohan. By now 27 years old, Helm would become the Crown Prince of Rohan and first in line to the throne.
Like the reign of Helm's grandfather King Déor, the reign of Helm's father King Gram saw a continuation of hostilities with the Dunlendings who would operate from the captured palace of Isengard to raid Rohan. In fact, the entirety of King Gram's 23-year reign was marked by open warfare with the Dunlendings, which Crown Prince Helm likely took part in. King Gram would die in TA 2741, and Crown Prince Helm, now aged 50, would finally succeed him as the ninth King of Rohan.
During his reign, King Helm came into conflict with an arrogant and powerful landowner named Freca.[1] Freca was a Dunlending with Rohirric blood; he claimed to be a descendant of King Fréawine of Rohan. Freca viewed King Helm with both contempt and scorn, while Helm mistrusted Freca and was wary of him.
In TA 2754, Freca attempted to intimidate and coerce King Helm into giving his approval and consent to an arranged marriage between Freca's son Wulf and Helm's daughter. Freca marched to a meeting of the King's council in Edoras with numerous retainers, planning to threaten the King into complying with his demands. In the resulting quarrel, Helm Hammerhand smote Freca with a single blow from his fist. The blow was so great, Freca died soon after. Enraged, the men of Freca left Edoras, and King Helm declared Wulf and his kin enemies of the King.[1]
Helm's fatal blow to Freca - The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim
Four years later in TA 2758, a combined force of Dunlendings under the leadership of Wulf, Corsairs of Umbar, and Easterlings overran Rohan. Helm was defeated in battle at the Fords of Isen, and withdrew into the Súthburg at Helm's Deep (which was later renamed in his honor). There, he endured a long siege.[1]
While King Helm and his younger son Prince Háma were besieged in the Hornburg, a force of Dunlendings under the leadership of Wulf also besieged Edoras. Prince Haleth, King Helm's elder son, led the defence of Edoras. He was the last to fall defending the doors of the Golden Hall.[1]
Shortly after Yule 2758, Prince Háma accompanied by a small force went out to search for food, but he and his men were lost in a blizzard and never seen again. The Súthburg held a large war-horn, and whenever it was blown, Helm would break through the Dunlending ranks, slaying many of their men. Helm was described as clad in white and stalking his prey, resembling a Snow-troll. Helm's enemies came to fear him greatly during this time, and it was believed that he became so fierce and terrible, that he slew many of them with his bare hands. It was also believed that when he grew hungry and had no food he ate men, grief, and hunger having made Helm more ferocious.
After one sortie, Helm went to fight and did not return; his body was discovered the next morning frozen in the snow still standing, dead, his eyes open, ready to fight. This led to a belief among the Rohirrim and Dunlendings that even in death the wraith of Helm Hammerhand still wandered through Rohan, and defended the Hornburg. Helm died in TA 2759 at the age of 68. His nephew Fréaláf Hildeson, who defeated the Dunlendings, succeeded Helm.
Helm was called Hammerhand because of his great strength and prowess with his fists: he was known to fight barehanded. This is sometimes attributed to a superstition that if ""he used no weapon no weapon would upon bite him"".[1][2]",

He became close to the great mariner and nobleman Aldarion and became a sailor and companion, along with a man named Ulbar on his ship accompanying him on his travels, including the one in SA 873. When the Hirilondë returned to the harbor of Rómenna in the autumn of SA 882, the year before Prince Aldarion became King of Númenor, Henderch was a steward to the prince.
Henderch accompanied his lord during his night ride to Hyarastorni to consult Hallatan, Aldarion's nephew. Afterwards, Aldarion spoke to Henderch and told him to ride homewards with his gratitude. Aldarion would never again return to Emerië.[1]",

When she died, the throne should have gone to their son, Tar-Alcarin, but Herucalmo usurped the throne and ruled under the name Tar-Anducal (""Light of the West"") from SA 2637 to SA 2657. Being an illegal claim to the throne of Númenor, Herucalmo was not recognised by historians as a rightful King of Númenor.
Upon Tar-Anducal's death, Tar-Vanimeldë's son Tar-Alcarin finally succeeded to his rightful throne.[1]",
407,"Late ,Third Age",TA 3019,Male,,Tall,Hirgon,Men,,,"Hirgon was bidden by the Steward Denethor II to bring to the King of Rohan a token of war. He rode to the camp of the Rohirrim at the risk of his own life to present the Red Arrow of Gondor to Théoden, King of Rohan, as a request for aid in their war against Sauron. After speaking to the king, he insisted on riding back to Gondor and Minas Tirith to assist in the struggle.
Hirgon was later found dead by the Riders of Rohan with his hand still grasping the Red Arrow, while on their way to Gondor.
He wore a riders' cloak of dark green over a coat of fine chain-mail, and a helm with a small silver star. Meriadoc Brandybuck nearly mistook Hirgon at first for Boromir, as they were similar in posture and appearance.[1]",

Hirluin slew many Orcs during the siege but he came to his doom when he was overwhelmed by the Orc horde at the breaking of Minas Tirith's Great Gate. Hirluin was buried before the gate at which he fell alongside Forlong. Afterwards, the memory of his death as with others was lamented in the Mounds of Mundburg.[2]",

After they chased off Ferny, Hob informed them of the changes in their homeland.

His Pipe-weed business led to the herb's popularity throughout the Shire and beyond.[1][2]
The Pipe-weed variety 'Old Toby' was named after him, and 'Longbottom Leaf' possibly refers to his home where the plant was first cultivated in the Shire. According to Herblore of the Shire, by Meriadoc Brandybuck, it was believed that Tobold Hornblower learned about Pipe-weed in Bree, as that was the farthest from the Shire that he traveled and the herb was known to have grown on the south slopes of the hill there. His date of death is not recorded, but he likely died sometime in the twenty-seventh century of the Third Age.[3]",

In the year 458 of the First Age Huor and Húrin dwelt with their kin in the forest of Brethil, when they joined a war party against Orcs. The brothers ended up in the Vale of Sirion, and were cut off from their company. Chased by Orcs, the Vala Ulmo caused a mist to arise from the rivers, and the brothers escaped into Dimbar. There two Eagles picked them up, and brought them to Gondolin.
King Turgon of Gondolin welcomed the brothers, remembering Ulmo's prophecy that the House of Hador would aide Gondolin in their time of greatest need. Turgon wished them to remain as he grew to love them, but the brothers wished to return to their kin. The brothers swore an oath to keep Gondolin secret, and Eagles brought them back to Dor-lómin.
In FA 462 Morgoth assailed Hithlum, and Huor's father Galdor fell defending the Ered Wethrin.
In about FA 470, Huor wedded Rían of the House of Bëor, and conceived a son. He named the child Tuor even before birth, and had to leave his home when called to the muster of King Fingon.
In the Nírnaeth Arnoediad the following year, Huor fought alongside Húrin and the Sons of Hador. In the midst of battle he met again with Turgon, and their meeting was glad. When the battle was lost, Húrin and Huor took a stand fighting off the Orcs, allowing Turgon to escape. Huor was finally slain by a poisoned arrow that hit him in the eye. Rían lived on until FA 473, when she died at the end of the Nírnaeth Arnoediad.
He was remembered by the Númenóreans as the heroic grandfather of Eärendil the Blessed.[1][2]

417,TA 899,TA 1149,Male,,,Hyarmendacil I,Men,Gondor,Unnamed wife,"Hyarmendacil was born Ciryaher to King Ciryandil, who was slain defending Umbar, under siege by the Haradrim and Black Númenóreans. As Gondor's enemies to the south had yet to be subdued or pacified, he began his reign by reorganizing Gondor's armies. He launched a great assault by land and sea on the Haradrim in TA 1050 and won a great victory, lifting the siege of Umbar and breaking the power of the Black Númenóreans for good. The Haradrim were forced to recognize him as their overlord and paid tribute to Gondor, and their sons where forced to live as hostages in the court of the king. After this victory, he called himself Hyarmendacil, meaning South-victor.
After the defeat of Harad, Gondor became very rich and during his reign the realm reached its greatest extent and power. The passes of Mordor were well guarded by fortresses, so evil found no chance to spawn during Hyarmendacil's reign. No one dared to contest his power and Gondor was at peace for the rest of his long reign of 134 years. He died in TA 1149 at the age of two-hundred and fifty and was the fourth and last of the Ship-kings. He was succeeded by Atanatar II, his son, who did little to maintain the power his father had built.[2]",

Born as Vinyarion, his father Aldamir was slain in a war with the Haradrim in TA 1540 and Vinyarion wished to avenge his death. He accomplished this in TA 1551 by invading Harad and winning a great victory over the Haradrim, proclaiming himself Hyarmendacil II, meaning in Quenya ""South-victor"" after his famous ancestor from the twelfth century of the Third Age.
He died in TA 1621 after a rule of eighty-one years, at age two hundred thirty and was succeeded by his son Minardil.",

He told the company to leave their weapons behind, by order of Gríma Wormtongue, before entering the King's hall. He disarmed Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, but against the King's orders permitted Gandalf to keep his staff with him as a courtesy, though he knew, as he remarked, that ""The staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a prop for age.""
Háma was present at the Battle of the Hornburg, and died defending the gates of the Hornburg. He was buried at Helm's Deep after the battle.[1]",
420,"Late ,Third Age","Winter of ,TA 2759",Male,,,Háma (Helm's son),Men,,,"Háma was born around TA 2719, a year after the death of his great-grandfather King Déor, the seventh King of Rohan, during the reign of his grandfather King Gram, the eighth King of Rohan. He was the second son of the King's eldest son Helm and his unnamed wife; he had one unnamed sister and an older brother named Haleth. Háma would spend the first twenty-two years of his life growing up in the court of his grandfather King Gram, who ruled over a time of increasing conflict with the Dunlendings. Gram died in TA 2741, and Helm succeeded him as king. Háma would by now be second in line to the throne, as second son of the new king.
In TA 2758, seventeen years into Helm's reign, the War between Rohan and Dunland broke out as a result of the death of the Dunlending leader Wulf's father Freca TA 2754. During the war, Háma was with his father and loyal band of followers who retreated to the fortress of the Hornburg to continue the war with the Dunlending invaders. Besieged for many months during the cruel Long Winter, Háma and a company of men ventured out to attack the enemy and look for food without permission of the king and were lost in the snow.
With the death of Háma as well as that of his father Helm and brother Haleth by the end of the war in spring TA 2759, there was no one of the original patrilineal line of Eorl to become King of Rohan. Therefore, the crown instead was passed to a second cognatic line starting with Fréaláf Hildeson, a son of King Helm's sister Princess Hild and therefore a maternal grandson of King Gram.[1]",
421,FA 441,FA 502,Male,"Golden, grey (in old age)",,Húrin,Men,,Morwen Eledhwen,"Life in Dor-lómin[]
Húrin was a grandson of Hador, of the House of Marach, or House of Hador. Húrin was the elder son of Galdor and Hareth of the Haladin, and he had a younger brother Huor. He was known to be of unimpressive stature, so much so that he could not wear the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin because it was too large on him to fit properly. Despite this, his prowess in combat surpassed that of all his peers.
In the year FA 458, Huor and Húrin dwelt with their mother's kin in the forest of Brethil, when they joined a war party against Orcs. The brothers ended up in the Vale of Sirion, and were cut off from their company. Chased by Orcs, the Vala Ulmo caused a mist to arise from the rivers, and the brothers escaped into Dimbar, where two Great Eagles picked them up and brought them to Gondolin. King Turgon of Gondolin welcomed the brothers, remembering Ulmo's prophecy that the House of Hador would aid Gondolin in their time of greatest need. Turgon wished them to remain as he grew to love them, but the brothers wished to return to their kin. The brothers swore an oath to keep Gondolin secret, and Eagles brought them back to Dor-lómin.
In FA 462 Morgoth assailed Hithlum and Húrin's father Galdor the Tall fell defending the Ered Wethrin. Húrin chased the Orcs away with heavy losses over the plains of Anfauglith. Afterwards, Húrin was the Lord of Dor-lómin, ruling over the Hadorian fief of Dor-lómin in Hithlum.
Two years later, he wedded Morwen Elf-Sheen of the House of Bëor, and later in the year their son Túrin was born. A daughter Urwen followed, but she died aged three years old in a plague sent from Angband.
Nirnaeth Arnoediad[]
In FA 473, in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Húrin fought alongside Huor and the Sons of Hador. In the midst of battle, he met again with Turgon, and their meeting was sweet. When the battle was lost, Húrin and Huor gathered all the remaining men of the House of Hador and they took a stand fighting off the Orcs, allowing Turgon to escape. Step by step, the army of Morgoth pushed them back into the Fen of Serech. They stepped back until the river Rivil was in front of them, there they did not take one-step back. They kept on fighting until dusk when Huor was slain. In the end, Húrin stood there alone, there he threw his sword and shield on the ground and he took a grand battle-axe of an Orc captain. He waded alone into Gothmog's bodyguard of Trolls, and with every one he slew he yelled with all his voice: ""Aure entuluva!"" (""Day will come again!"") This battle cry was heard seventy times.
Húrin enchained on Thangorodrim, by Kip Rasmussen
Húrin fought with the battle axe until the axe itself withered away from the caustic blood of the trolls he had been slaying. He was grappled by the Orcs and taken hostage, even though he hewed their limbs off as they grabbed him. Húrin was brought captive to Morgoth, and despite horrific torture at the hands of the second Balrog lord Lungorthin (who smote Hurin across the mouth with a whistling fiery whip), he refused to reveal the location of Gondolin. Due to his defiance, Morgoth cursed him and his family to misery and hopelessness.
Húrin was bound by Morgoth's power in a seat high on the peaks of Thangorodrim There, Morgoth cursed him with the ability to see from afar all the evils would befall his son, Túrin.[5] He never saw his second daughter Niënor, however, who was born while he was a captive.
Release from captivity and death[]
Hurin's last stand, by Jenny Dolfen
In the year FA 500, after the death of his children, Morgoth released Húrin, feigning pity to an utterly defeated foe.[6] In reality however, Morgoth hoped that the bitterness and hate that had been wrought in Húrin throughout his years of watching his family suffer would cause strife and misfortune to those whom Húrin encountered. He was brought to his old homelands in Hithlum, but the Easterlings now living there, under Lorgan, did not recognize him at first, and feared him, believing him to be high in the favor of Morgoth. The House of Hador had been destroyed or enslaved. Seven outlaws joined Húrin, and together they went to the vale of Sirion, where he knew Gondolin to be. In time Húrin abandoned the outlaws and sought for the entrance, but Gondolin was closed, and the King Turgon at first did not wish to allow him in. Húrin cried out against Turgon, thus inadvertently revealing the general location of Gondolin to Morgoth's spies, and then left. Only after he had left did Turgon have a change of heart, and sent Eagles to fetch him, but they came too late and did not find him.
The Death of Morwen, by Alan Lee
Húrin continued to the forest of Brethil where his son and daughter had died, and met his wife Morwen there at their grave, minutes before she too passed away. In anger and despair, he sought out the Haladin, blaming them for the death of his wife and children, and after being put on trial caused a revolt in which Hardang, of the house of Haldad, was slain.[7] Húrin met up again with the outlaws, and together with a few of the Haladin, they went to Nargothrond, where Húrin killed the Petty-dwarf Mîm who had claimed the treasure of Glaurung, earning a curse on the gold. Húrin and his outlaws brought the treasure, including the Nauglamír, to Doriath, insulting Thingol by giving it as a fee for his 'good care' of Húrin's kin. The outlaws did not accept this, and a bitter battle was fought at Menegroth, leading to the death of all of them, and further cursing the gold. Húrin thus brought a curse on Doriath as well, eventually leading to its downfall.
Melian's kind words managed to break through to Húrin's clouded mind, and Húrin finally saw that all his deeds had only aided Morgoth. A broken man, he finally cast himself in the sea and ended his life.",

Idril was loved in secret by her cousin Maeglin, the son of Eöl the Dark Elf and Aredhel, Turgon's sister, but she scorned his advances because of his dark character, as well as the fact that they were too closely related.[4]
Idril and her son Eärendil, by Egorit
When Tuor, son of Huor, arrived in Gondolin, Idril fell in love with him. Because Turgon had grown to love Tuor as a son (as he had his father before), he allowed Idril and Tuor to wed, thus bringing about the second union of Men and Elves, after Beren and Lúthien.[4] Their son Eärendil was born shortly afterwards.
Being far-sighted she sensed danger and she encouraged Tuor to prepare a secret way under the city so that if the city was attacked survivors could safely escape.[5] After the Fall of Gondolin, Idril and Tuor became leaders of the exiles at the Mouths of Sirion in West Beleriand in the region of Arvernien, where they also received Elwing, daughter of Dior.
When Tuor grew old, he and Idril departed in his ship for the West. It is believed by the Elves and the Dúnedain that Idril and Tuor safely arrived in Valinor, bypassing the Ban of the Valar. Moreover, it was thought that Tuor was reckoned in the kindred of the Elves, and that both Idril and her husband thereafter dwelt in Valinor.[6][7]",

War of the Ring[]
On March 9, TA 3019, Prince Imrahil led a company of Swan Knights and 700 men at arms to Minas Tirith to help defend the city. Prince Imrahil led the sortie that rode to the aid of Faramir and the rear-guard who were retreating from Osgiliath when the forces of Sauron overran the Pelennor Fields on March 13. Gandalf rode with them, and the Winged Nazgûl fled before the Gandalf's light. The Knights of Dol Amroth rescued Faramir from the Southrons but he was poisoned, and Imrahil carried his nephew back to Minas Tirith on his horse. Gandalf then took command of the besieged city, and Prince Imrahil assisted him because Denethor in his madness retreated to the White Tower with his dying son, paying no further attention to the city's defense.
During the Siege of Gondor, Imrahil and Gandalf made circuits of the Othram, bolstering the defenders before taking command of the defence of the Great Gate. On March 15th, with the arrival of Rohan, the defenders proceeded to sortie from the city to link up with them, with Imrahil leading the attack in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.
While paying respect to the procession bearing the body of King Théoden of Rohan, Imrahil noticed that the Rohirrim also bore the body of Éowyn. He perceived that she was still alive, and hurriedly had her sent to the Houses of Healing.
Éomer and his Riders were outnumbered, but Imrahil then rode into battle and came to their aid. Shortly after, Aragorn arrived in the Corsair fleet of the Umbar, and the tide of the battle was turned. After the Pelennor Fields had been cleared, Aragorn, Éomer and Imrahil rode to the Gate of Minas Tirith.
Imrahil recognized that Aragorn was the rightful King of Gondor, but he agreed that it was wise for Aragorn to wait to enter the city because Imrahil knew his brother-in-law Denethor was strong-willed and proud. When Imrahil learned that Denethor was dead and Faramir was dying, he suggested that Aragorn be summoned, remembering that the kings of old were great healers. Aragorn came at Gandalf's request to heal the wounded Faramir, Éowyn, and Merry, but he declared that Prince Imrahil should rule the city until Faramir awoke from his fevered slumber.
In the debate of the Captains of the West, Gandalf proposed that they march to the Black Gate to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo the Ring-bearer. Imrahil said that he would follow his liege Aragorn, but since Minas Tirith was under his command the Prince advised that some should remain to defend the City. In the end it was decided that an army of 7,000 would ride forth. Imrahil laughed and said:
""Surely this is the greatest jest in all the history of Gondor: that we should ride with seven thousands, scarce as many as the vanguard of its army in the days of its power, to assail the mountains and the impenetrable gate of the Black Land! So might a child threaten a mail-clad knight with a bow of string and green willow!""—The Return of the King: ""The Last Debate"")
The Army of the West left Minas Tirith on March 18. Bypassing Minas Morgul and marching north, the heralds announced the coming of King Elessar to Mordor at Imrahil's suggestion. When Sauron's forces emerged from the Black Gate on March 25, Imrahil stood in the front line. They fought the Battle of the Black Gate until the One Ring was destroyed.
Prince Imrahil was present at the celebrations of the Field of Cormallen, and the coronation of Aragorn as King Elessar, and rode with the funeral procession of King Théoden to Rohan, remaining in Edoras after the King's burial on August 10. Imrahil and Éomer became great friends, and in TA 3021 Éomer wed Imrahil's daughter Lothíriel.[1]
After the War of the Ring, Prince Imrahil and his nephew, Prince Faramir, were King Elessar's chief commanders. Imrahil was also part of the Council of Gondor, and remained an advisor to the King.
Prince Imrahil died in the year 34 of the Fourth Age, and was succeed by his eldest son Elphir, who continued the line of Princes.[2]",

Unfortunately, Fëanor harbored very little love for her or her sons which probably contributed to his mistrust of Fingolfin when Melkor began spreading his poisonous lies amongst the Ñoldor.[5]
After the death of Finwë and the rebellion of the Ñoldor, Indis and her eldest daughter Findis returned to their people of the Vanyar and dwelt there until Manwë restored Finwë to life. Their second daughter Irimë, however, went into exile with her brother Fingolfin.[2]",

Days after Gandalf had passed, an army out of Mordor crossed the river Anduin at Cair Andros and descended on Ingold's position. He retreated with those of his men who survived back to the city, reporting that the northern road had fallen into the hands of the enemy. This was woeful news in Minas Tirith, because it was thought to mean that the Rohirrim could not come to their aid (though in fact the Riders were able to find another route, the long-forgotten Stonewain Valley).[2]",

A small group of Númenóreans remained friendly with the Elves and faithful to Eru and the Valar. They were called the Faithful. Among these men were the Lords of Andúnië.
In SA 3262, Ar-Pharazôn, King of Númenor, took Sauron captive and brought him to Númenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken in order to corrupt the Númenóreans, to orchestrate their downfall. Over time, he succeeded in gaining influence over the Númenórean authorities.
Isildur learned that Sauron wanted King Ar-Pharazôn to cut down Nimloth, the White Tree that had come from the Undying Lands. Isildur disguised himself and went secretly to the King's Court and took a fruit from Nimloth. The guards discovered and attacked him and, although receiving grave injuries, he managed to escape with the fruit. For this deed, Isildur received much praise. He stood near death for many months, but when the fruit of the White Tree began to sprout, he awoke and was recovered from his injuries.[2]
As Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave Númenor. They filled nine ships with their families and many of their prized possessions, including the palantíri. Isildur had three ships of his own, and he brought aboard the seedling of the White Tree, the Stone of Erech, as well as his wife and his son Elendur, who had been born in SA 3299.[1]
Isildur's grandfather Amandil hoped to plead with the Valar to spare the Faithful. He sailed westward toward the Undying Lands, but what became of him is not known and he was never seen again.
Life in Middle-earth[]
The nine ships of the Faithful were spared from the tumult of Númenor's downfall, and a great wind from the west sent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north with four ships, while Isildur and Anárion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the south with three and two ships respectively. Elendil and his sons established the North-kingdom of Arnor and the South-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the High King of both realms, but he ruled from Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor to his sons.[3]
Isildur lived in Minas Ithil to the east of the Anduin, while Anárion made his home in Minas Anor to the west of the Anduin. They ruled from their joint capital of Osgiliath, built on both banks of the river. Isildur built Minas Ithil in a valley of the Mountains of Shadow on the border of Mordor, planting the White Tree of Gondor before his house there. Minas Ithil was a beautiful city, but it was also a stronghold to defend against the evil that might still dwell in Mordor. It was not known at first that Sauron had survived the Downfall and had begun to rebuild his strength.
Isildur had one of the palantír called the Ithil-stone, which he used to communicate with his brother and father. Isildur and his wife had two more sons while living in Gondor - Aratan born in SA 3339 and Ciryon born in SA 3379.
In the early days of Gondor, Isildur went to the Hill of Erech at the entrance to Imlad Morthond in the White Mountains. On the hilltop he placed the Stone of Erech, a great black sphere that he had brought from Númenor. Isildur met with the King of the Mountain Men, who swore allegiance to Isildur upon the Stone, but later when Isildur called upon the Men of the Mountains to join the fight against Sauron, they refused. Isildur cursed them and said that they would never rest until they fulfilled their oath, and they haunted the Paths of the Dead.[4]
Sauron attacked and captured Minas Ithil in SA 3429. Isildur escaped with his wife and sons and a seedling of the White Tree. Isildur and his family boarded a ship at the Mouths of the Anduin and sailed around the coast of Middle-earth, seeking Elendil in Arnor. Elendil consulted with Gil-galad, the last High King of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth who lived in Lindon west of Arnor. Gil-galad and Elendil formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men to oppose Sauron in SA 3430. That same year, Isildur's youngest son Valandil was born at the home of Elrond in Rivendell.
The Last Alliance[]
The army of the Last Alliance gathered at Rivendell in SA 3431[5] and then marched to war. Isildur and his three oldest sons Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon went with the army, while Isildur's wife and their young son Valandil remained in Rivendell.
The War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434. Sauron's forces were defeated in the Battle of Dagorlad on the plain outside Mordor, and the army of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and laid siege to Barad-dûr. The siege lasted seven years and many Men and Elves were killed, including Isildur's brother Anárion, who died in SA 3440.[6]
Isildur taking the One Ring, after his father and Gil-galad are slain - by Ralph Damiani
At last, in SA 3441, Sauron himself came down from his tower. He fought with Gil-galad and Elendil on the slopes of Mount Doom. Sauron's body was cast down, but Gil-galad and Elendil died in the struggle. Elendil's sword Narsil broke beneath him.
Isildur took up the hilt of the sword and used the broken blade to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Sauron's spirit fled from his body, but as long as the Ring that held much of his power survived so would his spirit. Enamored by the Ring's apparent beauty, Isildur took it for himself. Elrond and Círdan were the only two individuals who marked Isildur's actions, as they alone had been with Gil-galad during the contest with Sauron, and Isildur alone had stood by Elendil.[6] Not long after, with the heat-induced markings on the Ring still visible, Isildur wrote a short account of the Ring and its apparent properties, noting that it had burned his hand so badly that he believed he would be in permanent pain. He noted that the Ring, as it cooled, seemed to shrink, and that the writing upon its outer band seemed to be fading. He theorized that the heat from Sauron's hand might have caused the writing to remain visible, and that heating it again might produce the same effect. However, he was already so enthralled by the Ring that he refused, even in writing, to take any action which might cause harm to it.

Rule and death[]
Isildur assumed kingship of both Gondor and Arnor, but intended to return to the North and leave Anárion's son Meneldil to rule in the south, after mentoring him in the duties of a King. On the summit of Amon Anwar in the Firien wood, Isildur entombed the body of his father Elendil. Before leaving Minas Anor, Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree recovered from Minas Ithil in memory of his brother and established the Tradition of Isildur.
During the few years in which Isildur had possession of the One Ring, he indicated that he had attempted to bend its tremendous power to his own will. However, he had failed in this endeavor, and the Ring's effects on his psyche had continued to grow until he could hardly bear it any longer. His eldest son and confidante, Elendur, suggested to his father that he should give the Ring into Elrond's keeping, and Isildur agreed.[7] On September 5, TA 2 of the Third Age, Isildur set out from Minas Anor with his three elder sons and a company of knights. They marched up the Vales of Anduin on the eastern side of the river, heading for the High Pass over the Misty Mountains.
Thirty days later, on October 4, Isildur's company was attacked by Orcs near the Gladden Fields. The Orcs were unaware that Isildur had the One Ring, but instead were unwittingly drawn by its power. Isildur's men were outnumbered ten to one, and though they initially managed to repel the attack by forming a shield-wall, the Orcs renewed their assault after nightfall and the men were overwhelmed.[8]
Isildur putting on the Ring to escape
Before the battle had begun, Isildur had sent away his esquire Ohtar, bearing the shards of his father's sword Narsil. Isildur kept the One Ring, but it was useless in defending his men against the Orcs.
Isildur's son Aratan was mortally wounded, and his son Ciryon was killed. His eldest son Elendur begged him to flee to in order to prevent the Orcs from capturing the Ring. Isildur agreed and parted with great sorrow from Elendur, who was slain leading the remaining Dúnedain.
Isildur put on the Ring despite its pain and made for the River Anduin. He removed his armor and waded into the river intending to try to cross it. The current was strong and despite his great strength, it pulled him toward the marshes of the Gladden Fields. Then the Ring betrayed Isildur by slipping off his finger, and it then became lost in the waters. He rose out of the water but was spotted by Orcs who killed him with arrows.[7]
Legacy[]
The One Ring remained at the bottom of the Anduin river in the Gladden Fields until Déagol found it in TA 2463.[5] Isildur's body also lay in the waters, undiscovered by his kin, but his weapons and armour were later recovered near the place of battle.[7] As he had been wearing the Elendilmir, this was lost with him. Since the One Ring indirectly caused Isildur's death by slipping from his finger and revealing him to the Orcs, it became known in Gondor's lore as Isildur's Bane.
Isildur's youngest son Valandil became the High King of Arnor when he came of age in the year TA 10,[5] but he did not claim the Kingship of Gondor, and the two Kingdoms became separated. Gondor continued to be ruled by the heirs of Anárion, while Arnor was ruled by the heirs of Isildur. It was not until the end of the Third Age that the Kingdoms were reunited by Aragorn II, Isildur's heir. During his reign, evidence for the full story of his death was finally uncovered, as the Elendilmir and the necklace holding the One Ring were found in a secret chamber in Orthanc.[7] Saruman had likely found Isildur's remains and had them burnt.",

Her hair was yellow like the lilies that grew in the grass fields of Dor-lómin. She often took to ""going upon grass or under tree"", singing old songs from long ago that were made when the Edain first learned ""the tongue of the Elves"". It was because of this that Húrin once said to Morwen that Urwen was as ""fair as an Elf-child…but briefer"".[5]
During her short life, Túrin gave ""all the warmth of his heart"" to Urwen, though he rarely played with her, preferring instead ""to guard her unseen and"" watching her sing.[5]
Before the end of the Year of Lamentation, an sickness known as ""the Evil Breath came to Dor-lómin"" from Angband and both Urwen and Túrin fell ill. Sometime while Túrin still ""lay long in a fever and dark dream"", the Evil Breath took Urwen's life. Before Túrin recovered, Morwen blamed her death on the Enemy and forbade the household from speaking Urwen's nickname.[5]
After Túrin was healed and ""asked for Lalaith"", his nurse relayed Morwen's command to him. When Túrin went and asked Morwen why he could not speak his sister's nickname, she told him that ""Urwen is dead, and laughter is stilled in this house"". Húrin tried to ""make a song of lamentation"", but his harp broke instead, causing him to curse ""the Marrer of Middle-earth"". Though Túrin abided by Morwen's command, he wept for Urwen bitterly alone at night. He later revealed to Sador that he had imagined that Urwen would grow up to look like one of the Eldar.[5]
Túrin never got over her death and always looked for her likeness in women ever after.[7] During his time in Nargothrond, Túrin spoke of Urwen to Finduilas, confessing to her that she reminded him of how he imagined his sister would look grown up.[8]

War of the Ring
Legolas and Gimli at Helm's Deep, by John Howe
Legolas came to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, the great meeting held by the Elf lord Elrond, as a messenger from his father to discuss the escape of Gollum. When the council was choosing the ""Nine Walkers"" to pit against the ""Nine Riders,"" Legolas volunteered to represent the Elves, and to become one of the members of the Fellowship that would set out to destroy the One Ring.[2]
Legolas in combat with the Orcs during the Battle of the Bridge of Khazad-dûm
During their journey, Legolas would stay at the rear due to his keen eyes. On Caradhras, Legolas was able to run nimbly over the snow, leaving behind little imprint, whereas his companions struggled to plough through it.[3] When Gandalf gave his counsel, Legolas voted against passing through Moria. In the morning, the Fellowship was waylaid by Wargs and Legolas fought in their defence. After the battle, he picked up his arrows, save one which was damaged.[4]
Gimli quarreled with him in Moria (which was not unexpected considering the ancient quarrel between Elves and Dwarves) - Legolas' father Thranduil had once imprisoned Gimli's father, Glóin.[5]
He and Gimli became friends, however, when Gimli greeted the Elf, Lady Galadriel, with gentle words. Before the Fellowship departed from Lothlórien, Legolas was given a new Galadhrim longbow.[6] While the Fellowship was travelling over the river Anduin, he used his new bow to shoot an overhead Nazgûl on a fellbeast with one masterful shot in the dark.[7]
After the breaking of the Fellowship, Legolas and Aragorn sang a song of lament for the fall of Boromir.[8] He then led the way as he, Aragorn and Gimli raced through Rohan after the Uruk-hai who had taken Merry and Pippin. During that week, he was given a grey horse named Arod, on which he and Gimli would often ride together, from Éomer and his éored.[9]
In Fangorn Forest, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli were reunited with Gandalf, now called Gandalf the White. Upon their meeting, Gandalf delivered the messages of Galadriel to them:
Legolas Greenleaf, long under tree, In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea! If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore, Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.
—Galadriel's message to Legolas[1]
In the Battle of the Hornburg, Legolas and Gimli engaged in an Orc-slaying contest[10]  that Gimli won (the score being 42 to 43, respectively), though Legolas was not jealous, stating, ""You have passed my score by one but I do not grudge you the game, so glad am I to see you on your legs.""[11]
In Rohan, he and Gimli followed Aragorn, Elladan and Elrohir to the Paths of the Dead. His horse, Arod, refused to enter the paths, but Legolas calmed him. Their company rode on, with Elladan as the last, but Legolas looked back and saw the Dead following the Grey Company.
The Dead are following. I see shapes of Men and of horses, and pale banners like shreds of cloud, and spears like winter-thickets on a misty night. The Dead are following.
—Legolas in the Paths of the Dead[12]
""A Shot in the Dark"", by Ralph Damiani
Legolas fought in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields with Gimli and the sons of Elrond.[13] After the battle, he and Gimli entered Minas Tirith; Legolas sang an elven-song as he walked, and suggested that the city needed more gardens. They met Prince Imrahil and went to the Houses of Healing, at which he remembered the cries of the gulls at Pelargir and sang a song about his newly kindled sea-longing.[14]

After the war
Legolas and Gimli coming to Valinor, by Ted Nasmith
After the destruction of the One Ring and of Sauron, Legolas stayed for the coronation of Aragorn and his marriage to Arwen. Later, he and Gimli travelled together to Helm's Deep, visiting the Glittering Caves, and then traveled through Fangorn Forest as the two had previously sworn to each other they would. The Caves had seemingly left such an impression upon Legolas that he was speechless upon leaving them. Eventually, Legolas came to Ithilien with some of his people, with his father's leave, to live out his remaining time in Middle-earth helping to restore the woodlands that had been war-torn. After Aragorn's death, Legolas made a ship in Ithilien and left Middle-earth to go over the sea. His strong friendship with Gimli prompted Legolas to invite him to accompany him to the Undying Lands; making Gimli the only Dwarf to do so. He was never seen again in Middle-earth.[15][16]

In the year 488,[4] Lorgan's Men and Orcs launched an attack on the Elves that attempted to guide the sixteen-year-old Tuor to the south. Tuor was captured, and held as a servant by Lorgan for three years. During that time, Lorgan treated Tuor worse than his other thralls because he was related to his former lords and ""he sought to break…the pride of the House of Hador"". Despite this, however, Tuor endured it all ""with watchful patience"" until Lorgan slightly lightened ""his lot"".[2]
In the year 491,[4] when Lorgan sent Tuor ""with other thralls on an errand"", he slew his guards ""and fled into the hills"".[2] Despite the Eastrons hunting for him with hounds, Tuor managed to escape and hide out in the caves of Androth.[2] He harried the hills of Mithrim as an outlaw,[4] and Lorgan put a price on his head.[5] In the year 494, Lorgan heard of Niënor's beauty and desired to take her by force. However, Morwen and her daughter managed to escape to Doriath, seeking the news of Túrin.[6] In the spring[7] of 495,[5] Tuor disappeared from the north and Lorgan surely never discovered why his foe had vanished: Tuor had set out through the Gate of the Ñoldor on a journey that would lead him to Turgon in Gondolin.[3]
Twenty-eight years after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Lorgan and the Eastrons, along with the enslaved Men of Dor-lómin, were deceived into believing that Húrin was in league with Morgoth. When Húrin was released from Thangorodrim in the year 500,[8] he was sent to the border of Hithlum riding with a guard of soldiers as if in high honor. The Eastrons avoided adversity with Húrin to maintain Morgoth's trust, and allowed him to roam about in Lorgan's lands untouched. Húrin's bitterness was increased and even if he had wished he could not have roused a rebellion.[1]
In time, Húrin acquired a small following, composed of Asgon and six others. Deciding to leave Hithlum, Húrin marched up to Lorgan's halls to look upon him and his Men in scorn and to announce his departure from Hithlum. Lorgan was glad that Húrin was going and asked his ""friend"" to tell Morgoth that Húrin had not been ill-treated during his stay. Húrin rejected Lorgan's friendship and announced that his supposed service under Morgoth was a lie. At this, Lorgan's Eastrons drew swords to kill Húrin but Lorgan restrained them. Due to being more cunning and wicked than the others, Lorgan perceived that Morgoth pretended pity for the steadfastness of Húrin, letting him go free so as to unwittingly spread his malice.

Early years[]
Lúthien was the daughter of Elu Thingol, the Elven King of Doriath, and his Queen, Melian the Maia.[note 1] Throughout the years before she met Beren, she lived as all the Elves of Doriath did: in a state of perfect blissful peace. She was a woman of incomparable beauty and grace, with night-dark hair, sparkling grey eyes, luminous skin, and a clear heartbreakingly lovely voice that was said to cause winter to melt into spring - ""the song of Lúthien released the bonds of winter, and the frozen waters spoke, and flowers sprang from the cold earth where her feet had passed"".
She often enjoyed dancing in the woods of the realm to the music of her good friend Daeron's flute. He himself soon came to love her jealously, though she would not return it.

Quest for the Silmaril[]
Lúthien was remembered in the Lay of Leithian as the first immortal woman to ever fall in love and marry a mortal man, who in her case was Beren, a man of the House of Bëor whom she met in the woods of Doriath. Their relationship was unlikely from the beginning: Lúthien was not only the cherished single daughter of the most powerful Elven King in Beleriand, but also the daughter of a Maia, a powerful angelic being of the race of the Ainur. Beren was a mortal man on the run from the first Dark Lord Morgoth.
Lúthien singing for Morgoth in his throne-room, by Ralph Damiani
Thingol was determined to forbid Beren marry his daughter, and gave him an impossible task as the bride price: Beren had to bring to Thingol one of the Silmarils from Morgoth's iron crown. Against monstrous odds, including being kidnapped by the Sons of Fëanor and the death of Finrod Felagund, as well as a confrontation with Sauron, the couple achieved the task with help from Huan, the Hound of Valinor - but Beren died as soon as the task was completed. In grief, Lúthien soon lay down and died, passing to the Halls of Mandos. There, in her grief, she sang to the Vala Mandos. Her song was of such beauty that Mandos, for the first and only time in his existence, was moved to pity. But Mandos had no authority to allow Beren to live again, so he went before Manwë for advice, who in turn sought out the counsel of Eru Ilúvatar himself. Two choices were then placed before Lúthien: she could either dwell in Valmar with the Valar in bliss forever, as reward for all that she had accomplished, or she could be restored to earthly life again with Beren, on the condition that they would both be mortal and die the death of Men. For her love for Beren, Lúthien chose the latter.[2]

Later years[]
After this, she became a mortal and returned to life with Beren, dwelling briefly on Tol Galen. They had a son, Dior, who was called Elúchil, the Heir of Thingol.[3]
And thus in anguish Beren paid
for that great doom upon him laid,
the deathless love of Lúthien,
too fair for love of mortal Men;
and in his doom was Lúthien snared,
the deathless in his dying shared;
and Fate them forged a binding chain
of living love and mortal pain.

After the sack of Menegroth, Beren ambushed the Dwarves responsible and took the Nauglamír back to Lúthien. Her beauty combined with the splendor of the Silmaril and necklace to make her home of Tol Galen the fairest land ever to have existed east of Valinor. On her death, the Nauglamír was delivered to her son Dior, which led to the ruin of Doriath.[4]
Legacy[]
The union of Beren and Lúthien was the first between a mortal Man and a maid with Elven heritage. Her granddaughter Elwing married Earendil, son of Tuor and Idril, thus becoming the great-grandmother of Elrond and Elros, the first being one of the most influential figures of the Second and Third Age and the second the first King of Númenor. Her lineage passed down to the royal House of Elros of Númenor, and then through Silmariën to the Lords of Andúnië and the House of Elendil. When Aragorn II and Arwen married, the two lines of Lúthien's descendants were reunited, continuing her bloodline on to the Kings of the Reunited Kingdom and beyond. Lúthien's romance with Beren is one of the great stories of the Elder Days, and is mirrored by the later romance between Aragorn and Arwen Evenstar. According to legend, her line would never be broken as long as the world lasted.[2]
Due to everything she experienced from her decision to become mortal, Elwing decided upon the fate of the Elves for her and her husband, as she did not want to experience the same fate as her grandmother.",
461,"Late ,Third Age",,Male,Dark,Tall,Mablung the Ranger,Men,,,"In the year TA 3019, Mablung and his companion Damrod found Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in Ithilien, in eastern Gondor. Mablung was tall with dark hair and grey eyes, and wore the green and brown raiment of the Rangers with a hood and mask. He mainly wielded a bow, but had a sword and a knife also.
Mablung fought in the Battle of Osgiliath and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. He survived them, and warned the Men of the West when they marched to the Black Gate of an ambush planned by Mordor. He fought in the Battle of the Morannon, but his fate is untold.[1][2]",
462,"During the ,Noontide of Valinor",FA 587,Male,Dark red,Tall,Maedhros,Elves,,,"Young Maedhros, by Maureval
Maedhros was born in Eldamar, probably in Tirion, to Fëanor and Nerdanel sometime during the Noontide of Valinor. It was noted that, of all Fëanor's sons, he alone bore semblance to his mother by way of his red hair. It would be seen throughout his life that he inherited too some significant portion of her temperament, as unlike most of his brothers, he generally was neither quick to anger nor rash in his actions.
After the flight of Fëanor from Tirion in Valinor, he went with his father to Formenos. When Morgoth killed Finwë and stole Fëanor's beloved Silmarils, Maedhros was the first son to take the terrible Oath of Fëanor to recover the holy jewels.[4]
Maedhros participated in the First Kinslaying alongside his father and brothers. He was, however, the only one of Fëanor's sons to not participate in the burning of the Teleri ships, and he advocated for ships and oarsmen to return to Aman to ferry Fingolfin's host. When his father instead destroyed the ships, Maedhros did not object aloud, but instead stonily watched as the vessels burned.[4] After landing in Middle-earth, the Ñoldor were attacked by an army of Orcs, leading to the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. The Elves were victorious and the remnants of the Orcish army retreated to Angband, pursued by Fëanor and a small vanguard. But Fëanor's force encountered a number of Balrogs as they approached Angband, and were quickly slain. Fëanor himself was dealt a mortal wound by Gothmog, the Lord of the Balrogs, but Maedhros and his brothers arrived with a relief force to rescue him. However, Fëanor died from his wounds soon thereafter.

Soon after the Dagor-nuin-Giliath and the death of Fëanor, an embassy came from Morgoth acknowledging defeat, and offering terms which included the possibility of surrendering a Silmaril. Maedhros did not trust Morgoth, and so went to meet his embassy with more force than agreed upon. But Morgoth too expected treachery, and so sent further more troops, and amongst them were Balrogs. When the two groups met, the Elves were quickly slain by the Balrogs and Maedhros was captured. Morgoth then sent word to the Elves that if they forsook their war against him, Maedhros would be released. But the Elves knew that Morgoth would not honor his word and sent no reply. In response, Morgoth hung Maedhros by the wrist of his right hand to the face of a precipice of Thangorodrim with a band of unbreakable steel.[5] Shortly thereafter the host of Fingolfin, betrayed by Fëanor and abandoned in Aman, came at last to Middle-earth. The people of Fingolfin, harboring great anger over Fëanor's betrayal, were not welcomed by Fëanor's host for shame, and the two groups remained bitterly divided. However, Maedhros's cousin Fingon decided to set out alone in the hope of rescuing him. Though Fingon did not know of Maedhros's objection to the burning of the ships at Losgar, the two had been dear friends before Fëanor's betrayal, and Fingon wished to both heal the division between the two hosts and to rescue his cousin.

Fingon rescuing Maedhros from one of the Thangorodrim, by Rick Ritchie
The recent appearance of the Sun and Moon had prompted Morgoth to blanket the sky above Angband with nigh-impenetrable clouds of ash and smoke, to shield his servants. However, his legions were at that time still too daunted by the new lights to emerge from Angband, and remained underground. Aided by the ashen darkness and absence of Morgoth's servants above ground, Fingon reached Thangorodrim unassailed. Seeing that he could not enter Angband by any means, he began to sing a song in defiance of the Orcs hiding within Angband. Maedhros heard this song, and began to sing with Fingon, and thus Fingon located him upon Thangorodrim's slopes. But when he reached the foot of the precipice from which Maedhros hung, Fingon found that it was completely sheer, and he could not reach his cousin. In agony without hope of respite, Maedhros begged Fingon to shoot him. Fingon made to do, and prayed to Manwë to grant speed to his arrow for Maedhros's sake. Fingon's plea was heard by Thorondor, King of Eagles, who appeared swiftly and stayed Fingon's hand, and lifted him up to Maedhros. But Fingon was neither able affect the metal band from which Maedhros hung nor draw it from the precipice. Maedhros again begged Fingon for death, but Fingon instead severed Maedhros‘s hand above the wrist, and Thorondor bore them both away. Maedhros swiftly recovered but never forgot his torment, which drove him to become an even deadlier swordsman with his left hand than he had ever been with his right. In gratitude for his rescue and in atonement for Fëanor's betrayal, Maedhros relinquished all claim as Finwë's heir, and made his uncle Fingolfin, Fingon's father, High King of the Ñoldor. Maedhros' brothers resented this, but he openly defended this decision as being proper, as Fingolfin was the oldest living son of Finwë and was therefore next in line.
Maedhros after his capture, by Maureval
Seeing that the more ill-tempered of his brothers were likely to cause feuds with their kinsmen, Maedhros moved all of them and their people out of Hithlum, and later ruled the lands around the Hill of Himring,[6] which became known as the March of Maedhros. He established there a mighty fortress, not only to separate his rash and fiery brothers from the people of Fingolfin, but because he wished to have any attack from Angband fall first upon him. Allied with Fingolfin, he helped the High King win the battle of Dagor Aglareb. He stood with Fingolfin for nearly 300 years until the Dagor Bragollach, and thanks to his daring deeds during the battle, Himring stood while many other Elven realms fell. After a time, he even managed to re-secure the Pass of Aglond over which the fortress of Himring stood, and denied the forces of Morgoth entry into Beleriand through the March.
Soon after, he learned of Beren and Lúthien's successful quest to liberate a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. Realizing that Morgoth was not invincible, he took hope and gathered his brothers and united with other Elven Houses to create the Union of Maedhros, hoping to end the dominion of Morgoth forever. However, the Union was utterly broken during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Himring was captured by Orcs, and Maedhros and his brothers fled south, taking refuge upon the hill of Amon Ereb.[7]
Maedhros and Maglor prepared to fight and die after stealing the Silmarils after the War of Wrath
Several years later, Maedhros and his brothers learned that Dior of Doriath, son of Lúthien and Beren, had inherited the Silmaril that her grandparents had recovered from Morgoth. Still driven by the Oath, Maedhros allowed Celegorm to convince him to attack Doriath. During the battle, Celegorm, Caranthir, and Curufin were slain, as was Dior, King of Doriath. Dior's sons, Eluréd and Elurín, were captured and abandoned by Celegorm's cruel servants in the forests around Doriath. Maedhros bitterly regretted this deed, and he long searched for the innocent youths but could not find them.[8] After learning that Dior's daughter Elwing had survived and had taken the Silmaril with her, he and his surviving brothers descended with an army upon the remnants of the people of Doriath living in the Havens of Sirion. The Ñoldorin princes killed many Elves and captured Elwing's sons Elrond and Elros in the sack, but she and her husband Eärendil escaped to the West with the jewel.[9] Heartsick with the burden of the Oath and the deeds he had participated in to see it fulfilled, Maedhros and his brother Maglor took Elwing's sons under their protection.
Maedhros' last moments, by Lucife56
After the War of Wrath, he and his last surviving brother, Maglor, demanded the jewels from Eönwë but were denied, as they were judged by the Maia to be unworthy of the jewels due to their heinous acts. However, driven onward by the Oath, Maedhros convinced Maglor of the necessity of fulfilling it. As such, one night the two brothers snuck into the camp of the victorious Host of Valinor, slew the guard around the jewels and laid hands upon them. The camp was roused, and the brothers prepared to die defending their claim, but Eönwë ordered the brothers to be spared, and they left the camp unharmed. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned Maglor's and Maedhros' hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maedhros cast himself and the Silmaril he carried into a fiery chasm in the Earth.[9]

463,FA 320,FA 510,Male,Black,Tall,Maeglin,Elves,,,"Aredhel had left Gondolin to wander through Beleriand, and in the woods of Nan Elmoth, she met Eöl, and stayed with him, eventually giving birth to Maeglin. Eöl gave his child the name Maeglin when he was twelve. His mother told him about Gondolin and its people throughout his childhood and he desired to see his related kin in the Hidden City. He and his mother soon grew weary and discontented with their life in Nan Elmoth and Eöl's strict shunning of the outside world. When Aredhel finally decided to leave Eöl, she took her son (who stole his father's sword, Anguirel, forged of meteor iron) with her and returned to Gondolin. However, Eöl had followed her, and in judgement before Turgon, he attempted to kill Maeglin with a poisoned dart, but hit Aredhel instead. She died, and Eöl was cast down to his death from the city walls.
Maeglin was now an orphan, but Turgon held him in honor, and Maeglin both learned and taught much. He became an elven-prince held in high esteem, even leading his own noble house. He found rich loads of metals in the Echoriad surrounding the city and forged weapons of steel stronger than had been seen before. His mine in the Echoriath was named Anghabar, ""Iron Mine"". In the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Maeglin refused to remain behind as regent, and went forth to battle with Turgon. The seventh and final gate of Gondolin, the Great Gate of Steel, was Maeglin's creation.
Even though Maeglin was one of the mighty of Gondolin, his greatest desire was to take Turgon's daughter Idril to be his wife. But his desire was in vain, for Idril was his own first cousin, and as such was considered by Elven society to be too close in kinship with Maeglin to allow for any romantic relationship. Additionally, Idril was well aware of Maeglin's thoughts concerning her and despised him for it.
When Tuor came, carrying Ulmo's warning of the danger to Gondolin, Maeglin sat on the right hand of Turgon and argued against Tuor. The arguments made by Maeglin were instrumental in convincing Turgon not to leave Gondolin despite Ulmo's warnings, which ultimately resulted in the near-complete slaughter of the city's people. Seven years later, Tuor and Idril were wed and Idril bore a son, Eärendil, further increasing Maeglin's hate. Some time later, Maeglin was captured by Orcs while seeking for metals outside of the Encircling Mountains. He was brought to Angband and taken before Morgoth himself, who knew that Maeglin dwelt in Gondolin and was eager to learn its location. He threatened Maeglin with unimaginable torment, and though Maeglin was no craven, he was cowed by Morgoth's threats and betrayed the location and weaknesses of Gondolin in exchange for his freedom. Morgoth was overjoyed to obtain this information, and to further encourage Maeglin and ensure both his silence and his further aid, Morgoth promised him both rule of the city and the hand of Idril once Turgon was overthrown. Maeglin assented eagerly to this bargain. Afterwards, Morgoth released him and he returned to Gondolin without suspicion. When the hosts of Morgoth attacked and overran the city, Maeglin sought to capture Idril and fought with Tuor on the walls. But Tuor prevailed, and threw him from the wall to his death.
Maeglin was a relatively young elf, being merely 190 years old at the time of his death.[1]",

Maglor with his brothers and father swear the Oath of Fëanor, by Ted Nasmith
As with the other Sons of Fëanor, Maglor was bound by an oath to recover his father's Silmarils, stolen by the Dark Lord Morgoth.[2] This oath took the seven brothers to Middle-earth during the late First Age where they established realms in exile, waged war against the armies of Morgoth, fought their own Elven kind, and eventually brought ruin upon themselves.
Maglor took part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and he made the lament Noldolantë, the Fall of the Noldor, in memory of the terrible event.[2]
In Beleriand, he and his brothers followed their father and fought in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. Fëanor managed to disperse the armies of Morgoth but pressed on to Angband without his sons. Fëanor was mortally wounded in an attack by Balrogs and his sons bore his body back to Mithrim. As they drew near Eithel Sirion, Fëanor passed away after cursing Morgoth thrice.[3]
Maglor and his brothers traveled toward the east of Beleriand. Maglor founded the area between the hills surrounding Himring and Blue Mountains, called Maglor's Gap.[4] Years later, the dragon Glaurung passed Maglor's Gap and destroyed the lands about. Maglor and his people fled to Himring to join Maedhros before the Dagor Bragollach took place.[5]
After the Dagor Bragollach, the peoples of Bór and Ulfang came into Beleriand. They and their sons swore allegiance to Maedhros and Maglor.[5]
Maglor at the harp, with Maedhros, by Maureval
Following the taking of the Silmaril by Beren and Lúthien, Maedhros had formed the Union of Maedhros, an alliance between Elves and Men. Under him, Maedhros' host held the east to draw out the army of Angband while Fingon and his host would attack from the west. During the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Ulfang betrayed the Eldar and Edain. Maglor slew Uldor, son of Ulfang. The Union of Maedhros was broken and though the brethren were all wounded, none were slain. They escaped to Mount Dolmed in the east. After the battle, they took up a woodland life in Ossiriand.[6]
Maglor and his brothers learned when Dior, the new King of Doriath, possessed a Silmaril and refused to give them the jewel that had been won by Beren and worn by Lúthien. In the Sack of Doriath, Maglor's younger brothers Celegorm, Curufin and Caranthir were killed, and the Silmaril was not recovered.[7]
Afterwards, Maglor and his surviving brothers dwelt on Amon Ereb in East Beleriand. Hearing that Elwing, the wife of Eärendil, had escaped from Doriath with the Silmaril and was now living at the Havens of Sirion, the brothers did not act at once, repenting against their destruction of Doriath. But after a time, remembering their oath, they sent messages to the Havens of Sirion that offered friendship while demanding that the Silmaril be returned to them. And when these demands were refused, they mounted an attack on the Havens with their remaining followers, thus perpetrating the Third Kinslaying that resulted from the accursed Oath of Fëanor.

Though they won the fight, after spilling much of their kin's blood, they did not obtain the Silmaril for Elwing escaped over the Great Sea with it. After the carnage of the cruel bloodletting, Maglor and his brother Maedhros came upon the two young sons of Eärendil and Elwing, Elrond and Elros. With so much blood already on his hands, Maglor took pity on them and would not allow them to be slain. So, in the absence of their parents, he took them into his household and raised them as if they were his own children.[8]

After the War of Wrath, Maglor and his last surviving brother Maedhros stole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the Valar from Morgoth, even though initially Maglor tried to dissuade his older brother from doing this. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor and Maedhros's hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maglor cast his Silmaril into the sea. Thereafter, as the legend claims, he wandered along the shores of the world singing laments over the loss of the Silmaril, until he faded from memory.[8] In fact, however, Maglor perhaps could meet his death casting himself into the Sea out of despair and regret.[9]

467,UnknownYT,Still alive,Male,Brown with copperlike-red,,Mahtan,Elves,,Unnamed wife,"Mahtan was a skilled smith in Valinor who learned the arts of metal and stonework under direction of the Vala Aulë.[2] He wore a copper circlet around his head and was known for his fondness for metal above gold. Mahtan passed on his knowledge to his eager pupil and son-in-law, Fëanor, who surpassed his teacher by becoming the greatest of all Elven craftsmen. When Fëanor and certain Ñoldor became more proud and suspicious of other Ñoldor kin due to the lies of Melkor, and began forging armaments for what would be Valinor's first war, Mahtan came to regret teaching him. Later, Nerdanel became estranged from Fëanor and retired back to Mahtan's house. The servants of Aulë counselled against joining the Revolt of the Ñoldor, and therefore Mahtan chose not to rebel, and remained in Valinor in peace forever after.[1]
Mahtan had a beard, which was unusual for an Elf, especially a young one. J.R.R. Tolkien tells that Elves could only grow beards from the ""third cycle"" of their lives, while Mahtan was an exception, being only early in his second cycle. It is unclear what these ""cycles"" actually refer to.[3]",

Malach Aradan soon led a great part of his people, the ""Marachians"", westward of Beleriand to the country of Dor-lómin in the north which was given to his people by the Ñoldorin Elven-lords of the House of Fingolfin.
Malach Aradan married Zimrahin, a woman from his people who was later given a Sindarin name Meldis. He had many children by her and among his sons, Magor was his eldest son and heir, as well as a daughter Adanel likely his eldest child who was counted among the Wise of the Edain and was thus well-known as Adanel the Wise.

However, Manthor was related to Brandir through Halmir's daughter Hiril, who was the grandmother of Manthor and the sister of Halmir's son Haldir, who in turn was the grandfather of Brandir. This meant that Manthor's kinship with Brandir was worth less in the eyes of the people of Haleth, and he lost the election. And Hardang too was related to Brandir, as Brandir was his second-cousin through Halmir's other son Hundar, the brother of Haldir and the grandfather of Hardang. Hence, Hardang was the victor in the election, and he appointed Manthor to be the Master of the North-march at the Crossings of Taeglin.

His Stewardship began during the last part of the reign of King Eärnil II and throughout the reign of Eärnur, Eärnil's son.
During Eärnur's reign as king, Mardil was charged with the difficult task of restraining the desire of Eärnur to fight the Witch-king of Angmar, the chief of the Ringwraiths, who accused Eärnur after the Battle of Fornost of being afraid to fight him.
The King of Minas Morgul (one of the titles of the Witch-king of Angmar) reminded Eärnur of this and challenged him at the start of his reign in TA 2043. Although an angry Eärnur wanted to fight the Morgul lord he was restrained with difficulty by Mardil. However, when the Witch-king issued another challenge with great insult seven years later in TA 2050, Mardil could not restrain Eärnur, who then rode to Minas Morgul and was never seen again.[4]
Eärnur did not marry and thus had no children, so Mardil took it upon himself to rule Gondor. There was no one with a clear and unassailable claim to the throne, so the rule of the Stewards was a way of averting civil war. Because the fate of the King was unknown, Mardil made an oath to rule until ""the King returns"". This oath would be sworn by all of the Ruling Stewards. Mardil ruled Gondor with a steady hand and earned the nickname Voronwë, which means ""the Steadfast"" in Quenya.
During his rule, the Watchful Peace began when Sauron retreated from Dol Guldur in TA 2063 and went into hiding in the East. Upon Mardil's death in TA 2080 at the age of 120 years old, his son Eradan succeeded him as the second Ruling Steward of Gondor.

The Wainriders then enslaved the people of Vidugavia's realm.
His son Marhwini led a group of survivors to refuge in the Vales of Anduin, where they founded a colony and became the Éothéod, the ancestors of the Rohirrim.[1]"
479,"Mid-,Third Age",Mid-Third Age ,Male,,,Marhwini,Men,,Unnamed wife,"Marhwini was the son of Marhari, who led a remnant of Northmen from Rhovanion to battle alongside Gondor to stop the advance of the Wainriders years earlier. Through Marhari his father, he was also a direct descendant of Vidugavia, 'King of Rhovanion'.
Marhwini's father Marhari first aligned his people with Gondor in a fight with the Wainriders called the Battle of the Plains. In that conflict, King Narmacil II of Gondor was slain, as was Marhari. Marhwini then led a remnant of what remained of the Northmen to the vales of Anduin, where they mixed with fugitives escaped from the east. These people would come to be known as the Éothéod, they were the culture that would become the Rohirrim.
During the reign of King Calimehtar of Gondor, Marhwini sent word to Gondor that a host of Wainriders was preparing to assault the land of Calenardhon (later Rohan). Eager to avenge Gondor's prior defeat by the Wainriders, Calimehtar led an army out of Gondor and joined with Northmen under Marhwini. The combined force overwhelmed the Wainriders' army at the Second Battle of Dagorlad. As Marhwini had hoped, many thralls of the Wainriders who had once been among the Northmen revolted, and caused their captor's settlements to be destroyed. As the Wainriders retreated from battle, they were forced to retreat far to the east, having been defeated and driven from their homes. Thus the Éothéod were for a time victorious although the power of the Wainriders was only checked and not destroyed.

During the Quest of Erebor in TA 2941, when the company of Thorin arrived in Lake-town, they were taken by the captain of the guard through the marketplace to the Great House where the current Master was feasting. Subsequently, Thorin declared the return of the King under the Mountain. This news quickly spread throughout the town and the people began to shout, sing, and rejoice. The Master doubted that there ever was a 'King under the Mountain', and doubted even more so that it was Thorin, but he had to take heed of the clamour. Therefore, he pretended to believe Thorin's story, and the Master yielded his own great chair to him. The Master figured that the Dwarves would stay without fulfilling their promises, and then he could comfortably boot them out. The Master accommodated the Dwarves and Bilbo Baggins for two weeks before they thought about departing for the Lonely Mountain. The Master was shocked that Thorin would dare to approach Smaug and he wondered whether he really was who he said he was. All the same, he was more than willing to let them go because they were expensive to keep, and their arrival had caused business to come to a standstill. Alongside his councilors, the Master ""bade them farewell from the great steps of the town-hall"".[2]
The Master of Lake-town, acted by Stephen Fry
When Smaug attacked Lake-town, the people urged the Master to tell them what needed to be done. But as the flames leaped from the dragon's jaw, the Master fled in his gilded boat. Thus it was that Bard took control of the situation and ultimately slew the dragon himself. The surviving townsfolk gathered on the western shore of the Long Lake and lamented at the loss of their home. The people then directed their anger at the Master, accusing him of selfishness and calling him ""Moneybags"". They demanded that Bard become their king. In response, the Master, in a demonstration of his charisma and oratorical prowess, rebutted the people and convinced them that their anger should be directed towards Thorin and Company instead of him. The Master remained quiet as the survivors set up camps along the shore and Bard assumed effective control of all the people but did so only in the Master's name. When the hosts of Esgaroth and the Elvenking set off for Erebor to demand their share in the treasure, the Master did not go. Those who stayed behind began to prepare for the oncoming winter by building huts and collecting resources; meanwhile, the Master directed the process of planning a new town.[1]
After the Battle of Five Armies, Bard gave a large amount of gold to the Master for the help of the Lake-people. However, the Master caught the 'dragon-sickness', stole most of the gold and fled with it from Lake-town.[3] After his companions had deserted him, he starved to death in the Waste[3] sometime between TA 2941 and TA 2949. According to Balin, the new Master of Lake-town was wiser and very popular, because the people gave him the credit for the prosperity as much wealth went up and down the River Running.[3]"

After the War of the Last Alliance in which his father Anárion was slain, Meneldil was groomed by his uncle Isildur for a few years to rule Gondor, since Isildur and his sons intended to go north to rule Arnor. According to Unfinished Tales, Meneldil was farsighted and well-pleased at the planned departure of Isildur and his sons, hoping that affairs in the north would keep them occupied.  Meneldil became the third King of Gondor in TA 2 after the death of Isildur in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields.  Meneldil was the first King of Gondor who ruled independently from the High Kingdom of the Dúnedain, Arnor.
It is uncertain whether Meneldil was King by right, as young cousin Valandil would have had the better claim as High King of Gondor and Arnor, but no claim by Valandil was ever made. It was in any case unlikely that Meneldil would give up his right to rule to a much younger cousin he had never seen. In any case, the people of Gondor did not resist Meneldil's claim to the throne, and King Valandil and his heirs made no serious attempt to regain control over Gondor until the death of King Ondoher and his heirs. In effect, Meneldil thus severed Gondor from Arnor, but the title of High King remained with the northern line.

Meril was one of the Inwir, the royal clan of the Teleri,[5] being a great-granddaughter of Inwë, the King of all the Eldar. However, she was also akin to the Solosimpi, and had long ago seen the Bay of Faëry.[6]
Following the March of Liberation and the war with Melko, Ingil, her grandfather, led the remaining Elves and Gnomes to Tol Eressëa, where they built the city of Koromas, later known as Kôrtirion due to the great tower that Ingil built.[1] Later, Ingil returned to Valinor,[6] and eventually Meril became the Lady of the Isle.
At some point after the March of Liberation, when the Olórë Mallë was blocked and the children of Men could no longer visit Valinor in their sleep, one man nonetheless managed to find his way to the West and sought the Elves' help, to which Meril responded by asking Lindo, an Elf of Tol Eressëa, to devise a plan.[1]
Afterwards, Lindo and his wife Vairë built the Cottage of Lost Play in Kortirion, from which the remaining children of Men that stayed with the Elves went to the Great Lands and comforted the Mannish children living there.[1]
Arrival of Eriol[]
Around the 5th century AD, Eriol, a Mannish mariner, arrived to Tol Eressëa. After visiting many places on the island, including the Cottage of Lost Play, Littleheart, the son of Voronwë brought him to Meril's house, where Eriol requested to taste limpë, a magic Elven drink, seeking kinship and fellowship with the Elves.[6]
Meril denied, telling him that it is dangerous for a mortal Man to do so, as Ilúvatar made his Children different, and drinking limpë would erase his old desires but awake new ones; she also warned him that he would one day long for his lands again.[2] To explain better she told him the stories of The Chaining of Melko[2] and The Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr.[6]
Some time after, Meril visited the Cottage of Lost Play during a festival, before Eriol went to Tavrobel, where Littleheart told the tale of the Fall of Gondolin.[7]
The Faring Forth[]
According to one outline for the continuation of the Lost Tales, the disastrous Faring Forth, the great expedition to the Great Lands for the rescue of the Lost Elves, was instigated prematurely by Eriol himself against Meril's command, who, longing for his home, returned to the Great Lands and ""preached"" of the Faring Forth. Thus, due to Eriol's impatience and recklessness, the Faring Forth was doomed to fail.[8]

The Right Wing was to follow the king and his body guards to the Black Gate and onto the Dagorlad. However, the Wainriders sent their cavalry to launch a surprise attack on the main force, which the king was leading. The Wainrider assault overwhelmed the centre of the army, and King Ondoher fell. Minohtar then rallied his wing of the army to mount a desperate rear-guard defense, buying time for the un-engaged left wing of the army and the units at the rear of the ring wing to retreat. Minohtar and his men conducted a fighting retreat, but were ultimately overwhelmed at the entrance to Ithilien.

Húrin went off to fight in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad but never returned as the battle was lost. After the defeat of the Union of Maedhros, the savage Easterlings came to Hithlum to claim their new land as a reward for fighting for the Dark Lord. The Easterlings were cruel and took many slaves including the young and old. Morwen resisted the new Easterling lords that took over Húrin's land, and sent Túrin away to Doriath and the court of King Thingol, to prevent him from being taken as a slave. However, none of the Easterlings dared take Morwen's home, for her incredible beauty led them to believe she was a magical witch and in league with Elves, although she had neither such power nor intimate connections.[3] After most of the danger had passed, she went to Doriath looking for Túrin. Niënor followed her against her commands, but she was accepted by Thingol.[2][4]
Morwen was alarmed at not finding her son in Doriath, and after staying for a while, she and Mablung left to search for Túrin. Niënor followed against Morwen's will for a second time. While they sought for Túrin in the forest, Glaurung the dragon came upon them. He gave Niënor amnesia with his dragon magic and left. When Mablung found Niënor, she ran off into the woods, and was not seen by Morwen again. Morwen returned to Doriath after this sad incident.[2][4]

—The Silmarillion, Quenta Silmarillion, ""Of Túrin Turambar""
On the Narog river was a series of caves settled by the Petty-dwarves which they had named Narukuthûn[3].[4] By the year 52, only a remnant led by Mîm, their chieftain, lingered there, and they aided Finrod who sought to make a strong place that would be comparable to Menegroth. They were generously rewarded by Finrod for this.[5][6] Eventually Finrod had further help from the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains in extending the fortress, but these Great Dwarves despised the Petty-dwarves and had no compunction in ousting them, especially when it was for great rewards. Mîm developed a special hatred for the Elves because of this.[7] Mîm would then attempt to murder Finrod in his sleep, but this failed and he was driven out along with the rest of his people into the wild.[6]
At some point Mîm relocated to another Petty-dwarf settlement, Bar-en-Nibin-noeg beneath Sharbhund in Methiriad, where caves had been deepened and bored far under the hill during the long years that the Petty-dwarves had dwelt there. These cavernous halls were spacious enough to house a hundred or more at need.[8]
Encounter with Túrin[]
""But now at last they had dwindled and died out of Middle-earth, all save Mîm and his two sons; and Mîm was old even in the reckoning of Dwarves, old and forgotten.""
—The Children of Húrin, Of Mîm the Dwarf
In the year 486, Mîm and his sons, Ibun and Khîm, were out gathering in a place of many great stones, leaning or tumbled together. They may have been seeking for old treasures of a dwarf-house near these flat stones, and been carrying ingots of gold in heavy sacks which had been disguised.[9] Unluckily, they were spotted by a band of roaming outlaws who then pursued them, with one of the outlaws, Andróg, shooting at them with his bow. While Ibun and Khîm managed to escape into the dusk, Mîm lagged behind and was seized, though he struggled and bit like a beast, wounding Andróg's hand. Andróg assumed that Mîm was either an Orc or was of Orc-kin, and should be killed. This sentiment was echoed by another outlaw, Ulrad, who felt cheated upon finding that Mîm's sack seemingly only contained roots and small stones. The leader of the outlaws, Neithan, stayed them however, and bid for Mîm to be let up and permitted to speak.[8]
""Mîm the dwarf"" by Anke Eißmann
Mîm pleaded that he was old and poor, and for Túrin to not let him be slain without cause. When Túrin asked him what he could offer in ransom and noted that they were looking for a dwelling, Mîm offered to share his dwelling with them. Túrin accepted this, and swore to him that if they were brought there without trickery, then he would not be slain by any of the outlaws. Since it was late and dark, Mîm initially wished to depart and return for them the next day, but Túrin denied this without the pledge of his sack. When Mîm refused to be parted from it, Túrin had him brought to their camp despite Mîm cursing in Khuzdûl along the way; when they arrived, the outlaws put bonds on his legs, at which point he stopped cursing.[8]
The next morning, they released Mîm, and he declared that he would not forgive them for it tried to take back his promise. Túrin responded that Mîm still had to lead them to his home, and then stared into Mîm's eyes until Mîm could no longer endure it; he then beckoned for Túrin and the outlaws to follow him.[8]
Mîm spent the day guiding the outlaws, marching to Amon Rûdh. Once there, they climbed through hidden and perilous paths until they eventually arrived at the entrance to Bar-en-Nibin-noeg. After bidding them to enter, Mîm renamed the dwelling to Bar-en-Danwedh. As they entered, Ibun approached from around a corner with a small torch and informed Mîm in Khuzdûl that Khîm had been struck by the earlier arrow, and had just died at sunset. Mîm was grieved by this, exclaiming that being held in bondage by the outlaws had prevented him from able to heal his son. Túrin, pitying Mîm, claimed that he now held himself in Mîm's debt, promising that he would pay Mîm a heavy ransom of gold from any wealth he came by. Though Mîm marveled at Túrin’s promise, he demanded that Andróg break his bow and arrows and lay them at his sons feet; he further cursed Andróg that he shall never again take arrow or bow, otherwise he shall die by it. Andróg begrudgingly did this, but cursed Mîm in turn that he would die with a dart in his throat.[8]
""Túrin and his Band are Led to Amon Rûdh"" by Ted Nasmith
The next day, Mîm stated that he and Ibun would serve as guides when the Men went out, sharing his earth-bread with all of them except Ulrad because he had been the one who put bonds upon him earlier. The outlaws remained there for the rest of year, going on no more raids and only stirring abroad for hunting or gathering of food. While Mîm tolerated them, the outlaws eventually became uneasy about sharing the dwelling with Mîm, as he would often appear out of some shadowy corner or doorway when they thought he was elsewhere. It was otherwise for Túrin however, as he became ever more friendly to Mîm, often sitting for hours listening to his councils, lore, and tales of his life. As a result, Mîm became pleased by this, and sometimes allowed Túrin to enter his smithy.[8]
In midwinter, Beleg the Elf, a dear friend of Túrin, suddenly came among them, bearing great items such as the Helm of Hador and lembas from Melian.[8] Mîm hated Beleg, as he was one of the Sindar, the Elves hated the most. This hatred grew as he became jealous of the love that Túrin bore to Beleg and it became fiercer when Beleg seemingly undid the curse he had laid on Andróg: the outlaw had taken up bow again, and was struck by a poisoned orc-arrow, but his life was saved by Beleg.[10] At one point, Mîm theorized that if he ate some lembas, he would renew his youth and grow strong again. However, since he could not obtain it stealthily, he feigned sickness and begged for it from Beleg, only for the Elf to refuse. This set the seal on Mîm's hatred.[11]
Together, Túrin and Beleg did great deeds and pushed back Morgoth's forces, but in response Morgoth sent a great many spies to locate their hideout. Mîm became aware of the presence of Orcs in the lands around Amon Rûdh, and he and his son Ibun soon became ensnared with them. Differing tales speak of this being either an intentional act by Mîm due to the hatred he bore against Beleg, or unintentional due to Ibun being captured and threatened with torture. Either way, Mîm agreed to lead Morgoth's forces to Túrin's hiding place, but on the following conditions: that he be paid the weight of iron for any Man they caught or slew, but of Túrin and Beleg in gold; for Mîm's house be left to him; for Beleg be left bound for Mîm to deal with; and for Túrin to be let go free. The emissary of Morgoth readily agreed, though with no real intention of upholding the promises, and insisted that Ibun be kept as a hostage. Mîm became afraid at this and tried to back out, but with the Orcs holding Ibun, he was obliged to guide them.[10]
Mîm led the Orcs through the secret paths, resulting in the sacking of the hideout. All of the outlaws were struck down, with Andróg being mortally wounded by an arrow, and Túrin and Beleg captured with nets. Only Andvír managed to escape. Túrin was carried off, but Beleg was left wounded and bound with his wrists and ankles tied to iron pins driven into the rock. Mîm, who had been lurking in the caves during the battle, emerged to gloat over Beleg while sharpening a knife. Andróg, however, managed to crawl through the dead bodies, seizing a sword which he thrust at the Dwarf. Mîm fled, retreating down a steep and difficult goat's path, shrieking in fear.[10]
Return to Nargothrond[]
""Now Elves and Men shall rue this deed, and because of the death of Mîm the dwarf shall death follow this gold so long as it remain on Earth, and a like fate shall every part and portion share with the whole.""
—Mîm's last words[12]
Eventually in the year 499,[13] after Túrin had slain Glaurung, Mîm made his way back to ruined Nargothrond. Finding the halls unguarded, he took possession of the hoard, sitting there joyfully while ""fingering the gold and gems"" through his hands. He also sang many ""black songs of enchantment""[12] to bind the hoard to himself.[14]
In the year 502, when a band of outlaws led by Húrin, who had witnessed all that had happened to Túrin due to being cursed to see with Morgoth's eyes, came to the Doors of Nargothrond, Mîm met with them, demanding to know their purpose.[15] When Húrin refused to answer, Mîm told him of his own history and claim to the hoard, only for Húrin to vindicate Mîm as partially responsible for Túrin's fate.[15] Despite Mîm's attempts to beg for his life,[15] Húrin slew him.[16]
However, with his dying breath, Mîm uttered a final curse on the treasure of Nargothrond. After this, Húrin's company then took the treasure to Doriath.[13] As a result of Mîm's curse, however, most of the company was slain in quarrels amongst themselves along the way.[14]",

They both found love for each other, but she refused to marry him.[2]
After a Balrog awoke in nearby Khazad-dûm in TA 1980, Nimrodel grew more uneasy in Lórien. She fled, and made her way to the edge of Fangorn Forest, but could not enter it. Amroth found her, and promised her peace. Together they travelled to Edhellond, the port city in Belfalas, and thence set sail to the Undying Lands. They were accompanied by a small staff of Silvan Elves, including Mithrellas. All went well until they reached the White Mountains in TA 1981. The group became separated, and Amroth reached Edhellond well before the others. He decided to wait for his love aboard their ship. When a storm broke loose and swept the ship out of port, Amroth leaped overboard, hoping to swim back to shore.

After she and her mother heard a rumour that the mysterious Mormegil of Nargothrond was actually Túrin, they set out with a company of Elves for that place. Unfortunately, the dragon Glaurung had just sacked that Elven city, and, sensing their approach, he caused a cloud of foul vapor to rise from the Narog. The party's horses panicked and Niënor was separated, at which point the worm Glaurung used his abilities to put her in a state of total amnesia.

Eventually, the amnesiac woman was found by Mablung, who intended to take her back to Doriath but they were attacked by Orcs while attempting to cross the Taeglin. In confusion and terror, Niënor ran away, tore off her clothes and ran naked through the forest until she fainted.
Niënor and Glaurung, by Donato Giancola
Her brother Túrin found her, naked and terrified, at Haudh-en-Elleth, lying on the grave of his dead lover Finduilas. Because Niënor did not remember her identity and Túrin did not know his sister, as he had never seen her before, he named her Níniel which means ""Tear-Maiden"", and brought her to safety at the Forest of Brethil.
The men of Brethil returned to Obel Halad soon after. When ""Níniel"" fell sick, Brandir tended to her, secretly falling in love. However, ""Níniel"" loved Túrin more, and after three years, they were wed. By the next spring, she was halfway through her first pregnancy.

It was then that rumours of Glaurung's approach reached Túrin, who went out to slay him. Unfortunately, the dragon envenomed him even as he dealt the worm a mortal blow, and Túrin fell into a swoon.
At this unfortunate moment, ""Níniel"", who feared for her husband's life, went out and found him apparently dead. Glaurung then set off his hidden weapon against Túrin - he removed Niënor's amnesia with his last words. Realising she had married her own brother, was carrying his unborn child and believing he was dead, she committed suicide by throwing herself into the ravine at Cabed-en-Aras. Her death sparked a series of events culminating in his suicide, thus fulfilling Glaurung's vengeance.[2][4]",

War of the Dwarves and Orcs[]
Náin was one of the Dwarves who took part in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs around TA 2790 - TA 2793. During the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799, Náin turned the tide of battle when he arrived with a fresh army of Dwarves, who drove through the host of Orcs up to the East-gate of Moria. Náin stood before the Gate, and in his wrath he cried with a great voice for Azog to come out and face him. Finally Azog appeared, fresh and fully armed, and the two fought. Náin withstood Azog's assault until, blinded by his great rage, he swung a great stroke with all his strength at Azog. The Orc chief dodged the blow and kicked Náin’s leg, causing him to fall forward. Náin's mattock splintered on a nearby stone, and Azog's return swing broke Náin's neck, killing him.
Azog didn't have long to celebrate his slaying of the great Dwarf, as his host was in the midst of a great rout. Then, as he attempted to re-enter Moria, the young Dáin Ironfoot leaped up the steps and with his red axe decapitated Azog, avenging his father's death. Náin’s body was cremated on great wooden pyres along with the other Dwarves who had fallen in the battle.

Nár, sensing danger, cautioned Thrór to beware, but Thrór did not listen to his counsel and walked proudly into Moria as its rightful heir.
Nár stayed outside and hid nearby for three days. Then Azog, the orc chief of Moria, had the decapitated body of Thrór flung out onto steps of the East-gate, to which Nár was filled with horror. Azog then used Nár as a messenger, demanding that he return to his people and warn them that beggars, who dared enter Moria and attempt thieving, would fare the same. Azog declared that he had killed Thrór and that he now ruled Moria as king. Nár was prevented from retrieving the severed head of Thrór, on which Azog had carved his own name. As a final insulting gesture, he was struck with a small pouch of coins that were of little value.

Olwë and both his brothers ware born in Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees to unnamed parents, and their father was the direct descendant of  Enel and Enelyë.[5] After Oromë discovered the Quendi, Elwë and Olwë became both lords of the third clan of the Elves, the later Teleri, and together they lead their people from Cuiviénen to the West.[6] However, during a long wait in Beleriand Elwë disappeared. After years of searching, Olwë grew impatient, and led the greater part of the Teleri to Valinor, on the insistence of the Vala Ulmo.[2]
Olwë became Lord of the island of Tol Eressëa, where the Teleri built a great number of cities, and grew in number. When they finally came to Eldamar some centuries later, Olwë became Lord of Alqualondë. His daughter Eärwen married Finarfin son of Finwë[2] and later High King of the Ñoldor in Valinor, and thus their children, when these returned to Middle-earth, could claim kinship to Thingol, for Eärwen had several sons.
When Fëanor resolved to return to Middle-earth in pursuit of Morgoth, he came to Alqualondë and spoke to the Teleri asking for aid and for the use of the Swanships but he could not move them. He then grew hot and wrathful and, grudging he spoke to Olwë, he accused him of renouncing their friendship and for being ungrateful for the help that the Ñoldor had given his people in the past. Then Olwë said to Fëanor that this was not so and that he believed that as a friend it was right for him to keep a friend from doing something unwise. Then he spoke to him of the many things that they accomplished on their own without any aid from the Ñoldor, and that the Swanships were one of those things and were very dear to them.[7]
Olwë, by Righon
Seeing that he was not going to get what he wanted, Fëanor waited beyond the walls until he gathered his strength and then in defiance of Olwë he and his people began manning the ships. His people resisted and a battle had begun and many on both sides were slain, but the Teleri withstood them for a time. Then the host of Fingon arrived and believing that the Teleri had been told to waylay the Ñoldor by command of the Valar, joined the battle and the Teleri were overcome. No doubt Olwë had watched in horror many of his people dying and he could do little for he called upon Ossë, their patron Maia but there was no answer; all Maia had been forbidden by the Valar to interfere in the Ñoldor's departure from Aman. Ossë would however conjure terrible storms in vengeance for the Ñoldor's crimes, sinking many of the stolen ships and drowning their Ñoldor crews.[7]
The cruel slaying at the havens continued to haunt Olwë and his people for many years to come. Towards the end of the First Age when the Valar were preparing for the final assault on Morgoth, the Teleri of Olwë agreed only to sail the ships, but would send no more marriners than were strictly necessary to do so, and none would participate in the coming war.[8]",

During his time the rulers of Gondor and Arthedain became aware that a power was coordinating attacks on the Exiles of Númenor, leading to the two kingdoms to renew contact and form an alliance. Ondoher's daughter Fíriel married Prince Arvedui of Arthedain.
In TA 1944, the Wainriders invaded Gondor from the east while their allies, the Haradrim, invaded Gondor from the south. Ondoher and his eldest son and heir, Artamir, led the main army close to the Black Gate, where they clashed with the Wainriders. The left wing of Ondoher's army was commanded by Adrahil, the Prince of Dol Amroth. The right wing was commanded by Minohtar, the captain of Gondor's armies. The center was commanded by Ondoher himself.
In the ensuing battle Ondoher was slain together with Artamir, and Gondor was defeated.
The rearguard of the army defended Ithilien while Adrahil joined up with General Eärnil, who had defeated the Haradrim.
Although Eärnil finally defeated the Wainriders, it was learned that Ondoher's second son Faramir (not to be confused with Faramir, brother of Boromir) was slain with his father, despite a law requiring that at least one heir should be left behind.
There was therefore a succession crisis, with two claimants coming forward: Arvedui of Arthedain and Eärnil. Although Arvedui had a strong claim by his way of his wife Fíriel, who by ancient Númenórean law now should have become Ruling Queen and further claim as a descendant of Isildur and theoretical High King, the throne was granted by Steward Pelendur and the Council of Gondor to the general Eärnil, a descendant of Anárion, who would reign as King Eärnil II.[2]

Even as his grandfather (father) Finarfin and many of his House turned back to Valinor, Orodreth stayed with his uncle Fingolfin and his host and pursued his journey to Middle-earth.[4]
Orodreth once held the isle of Minas Tirith in the vale of Sirion[5] until Sauron overran the isle and turned it into Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Orodreth then fled south to Nargothrond.[6]
When Beren came to the Kingdom of Nargothrond, King Finrod went with him on his quest for the Silmaril.

Oropher with Thranduil, by Kazuki Mendou
Oropher was one of the Sindar of Doriath.  After the War of Wrath, he declined to depart Middle-earth as many others did, and instead went over the Blue Mountains with his household. He eventually ended up in Greenwood the Great, where Silvan Elves of Nandorin descent lived, and he was taken by them as lord. His capital was at Amon Lanc.[1]
West of Oropher's realm was the realm of Lórinand across the Anduin, where Amdír, another Sindar, ruled over Silvan Elves.[1]
War of Last Alliance[]
Before the War of the Last Alliance, Oropher and his folk left their capital at Amon Lanc and crossed Anduin to live with their kin in Lórinand. Three times, he moved his people northwards, eventually settling around Emyn Duir, the Mountains of Mirkwood. His retreat northwards was because of his desire to move ""out of range"" from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm and avoid the threat of Mordor.[2]
Though he and his people had little relation with other peoples of Middle-earth, Oropher understood that there could be no lasting peace until Sauron was defeated. Oropher answered the summons for the Last Alliance of Elves and Men but marched as an independent force with Amdír, King of Lórien. He joined with Gil-galad's forces as they marched down the Anduin to Dagorlad. Oropher's force was lightly armed and untrained in fighting pitched battles in the open.[1]
In the Battle of Dagorlad, Oropher's company fought valiantly, but he was slain with the greater part of his people when he, with King Amdír and his warriors, called an early charge upon the enemy without orders from the Ñoldorin High-king Gil-galad. After Sauron was defeated, Thranduil, Oropher's son and heir, returned to Eryn Galen with the shattered remnants of his people's grand army. Nevertheless, while depleted, his army was still large enough that the Orcs hiding in secret in the Misty Mountains did not dare attack them.[1]",

During this time he rebuilt and greatly added to it and over time it would become a city as well as a fortress, until after the Great Plague of 1636 when it became the capital of Gondor, over twelve-hundred years later.
In the last two years of his reign the Easterlings started attacks on Gondor. Due to his advanced age, he sent his son Tarostar (later Rómendacil) to meet the Easterling threat, who was victorious.

He was the head of the family for many years, and his son Lotho had ambitions to succeed Bilbo (and later Frodo) as head of the Baggins family. Had that happened before he died, Lotho would have called himself 'Baggins-Sackville-Baggins'.[1][2]",
527,TA 1879,TA 1998,Male,,,Pelendur,Men,,,"Pelendur was born in TA 1879, he was a descendant of Húrin of Emyn Arnen, an earlier Steward of Gondor and the grandfather of Mardil Voronwë, the first Ruling Steward of Gondor.
Pelendur helped Gondor through a constitutional crisis following the premature death of King Ondoher and his heirs in battle in TA 1944. He effectively ruled the kingdom for one year while observing the claims of the two claimants, Prince Arvedui of Arthedain and the general Eärnil who was victorious in battle against the Wainriders (Easterlings).
Pelendur dismissed Arvedui's claim maintaining that the rule of Gondor belonged to the heirs of Anárion, even though Isildur was the High King of both Gondor and Arnor before his death. Arvedui also argued, his wife Fíriel, the daughter of Ondoher should rightfully become Ruling Queen due to the old Númenorean law of accession, which stated the eldest remaining child of the king should inherit the throne. Pelendur rejected Fíriel's claim saying in Númenor, it was peaceful enough to have women as rulers. However, the Realms in Exile were constantly under attack and therefore needed a male ruler to lead the armies.
Based on these arguments the Council of Gondor, under the influence of Pelendur, threw out Arvedui's claim and chose Eärnil as King, in TA 1945 defying the Númenórean law of succession. Although Pelendur's choice prevented the heirs of Isildur from reuniting the Realms in Exile, it may have averted another Kin-strife. Eärnil, the victorious general and a direct male heir of Anárion, had become a hero in Gondor and had the support of the populace for his deeds in battle. Installing Arvedui, a foreigner, as king could have stirred up resentment amongst the people of the coastlands and the supporters of Eärnil, who had saved Gondor.

528,"Early ,First Age",,Male,,Tallest of the Elves of Gondolin,Pengolodh,Elves,,,"First Age[]
Pengolodh was born in Nevrast to a Ñoldorin lord and a Sindarin lady. Early tales about the Fall of Gondolin mention him as one of the lords of the city, and ruler of the Twin Folk of the Pillar and the Tower of Snow. As one of the Lambeñgolmor, he was known as the Sage of the Ñoldor, and counted as the greatest Loremaster since Fëanor and Rúmil. He was also the tallest of the Elves of Gondolin.
Pengolodh escaped the sack of the city with Tuor and Idril's company of survivors, and followed them to the Mouths of Sirion. He is not further mentioned in writing, but since the Annals of Beleriand are attributed to him, as well as the edited Annals of Aman (furthering the work of Rúmil), he must have stayed in Lindon for at least a while after the War of Wrath, so that the Dúnedain could copy his work.
It was during his stay at the Mouths of Sirion that Pengolodh did the majority of his work. Is attributed to him the composition of the Lhammas and other prominent linguistic texts from ancient Middle-earth, in which he collected much material concerning also the mátengwië, the gesture-code of the Elves.[1] Basing on information obtained from the refugees of Doriath, he made copies and extracts of documents written in Cirth, possibly preserving them as an active writing system.
Second Age[]
Later, in the Second Age, he lived in the Ñoldorin kingdom of Gil-galad in Lindon. Pengolodh was one of the few Elves admitted into Khazad-dûm, where he might have learned Khuzdûl. Pengolodh left Middle-earth during the War of the Elves and Sauron after the fall of Eregion, and left for Tol Eressëa, last of the Loremasters to leave Middle-earth.
900 A.D[]
After removing himself to Tol Eressëa, Pengolodh dwelt in a village called Tavrobel (or Tathrobel). Centuries later, Ælfwine spoke with him there.[1] When Ælfwine discovered the island of Tol Eressëa (c. 900 A.D.) he was told stories by Pengolod or studied his works (and those collected by Pengolod from other authors both Elves and men) and translated them.
Pengolodh's collection also included the writings of Rúmil and Dírhaval.",

Ragnir was the youngest member of this company.[1] The company crossed the Ered Wethrin and went down the course of the Lithir to the southern end of the Vale of Sirion. There Húrin decided to return to Gondolin, but he could not tell his desire to anyone due to his oath of secrecy. Thus, one night near the Brithiach, Húrin waited until the others slept and then he fled alone. When the company discovered the escape of Húrin, Ragnir suggested to give up the quest and come back to Dor-lómin, because their lord clearly wanted to flee alone.[1] However, Asgon replied that was their duty to find and follow him everywhere and then suggested to look for him in nearby Brethil, saying that the Men of Brethil were good and that they would welcome them even if they were strangers, since the Lord of Brethil was akin to the House of Hador. Despite Ragnir's pessimism, the company chose to follow Asgon into the forest, because he was notoriously stout and lucky. In the forest the company fell asleep, but they were soon noticed by the march-wardens of Brethil and took captive. In the early morning, they were brought before Ebor, captain of the march-wardens, who claimed that because the Master of the North-march was not with them at that time, he had to bring them before the new Chieftain of Brethil, Hardang son of Hundad. Thus, the prisoners were blindfolded and lead by devious ways to Obel Halad, where Hardang scorned and accused them of spying. Finally, their weapons were taken and the company was ejected from Brethil, because Túrin murdered Brandir, but their lives where spared because the Haladin where grateful for the slaying of Glaurung. After guiding them blindfolded back to the North-march, Ebor chose to give them their weapons back, but warned them to not enter Brethil again, or they all would be killed on sight.[1] Once survived this misadventure, Ragnir asked to Asgon what they should do, wryly noting that they were still alive thanks to Asgon's luck. Asgon suggested to go to the Crossings of Taeglin, because he still wanted to seek Húrin and hoped that there they will hear news about him. Despite he chose to follow Asgon westwards, once again Ragnir commented that they might instead hear bow-strings and be killed on sight.

Tarostar defeated the Easterlings, after many battles, by TA 500. After the victory he renamed himself Rómendacil, meaning ""East-victor"".
It was he that created the office of the Steward of Gondor, as a high councilor to the king.[3] When the line of kings failed two thousand years later, the holders of this office would rule Gondor.

This alphabet was later expanded and perfected by Fëanor as the Tengwar. Rúmil was also a skilled linguist, and when the Teleri finally arrived in Valinor he was first to discover just how the Telerin language had changed from Common Eldarin compared to Quenya. He became part of an Elvish culture of loremasters known as the Lambeñgolmor.

Lobelia was known to be a covetous and grasping hobbit, and had designs on Bag End, as Otho was Bilbo's paternal first cousin and next of kin. During Bilbo's disappearance, Lobelia and Otho claimed the smial; when Bilbo returned from his adventure with Thorin and Company, Lobelia and Otho were in the midst of auctioning off the contents of Bag End with the firm of Grubb, Grubb and Burrowes.[1]
After Bilbo's eleventy-first birthday party, Lobelia and Otho were incensed that Bilbo had left Bag End to Frodo, a more distant cousin once removed, and questioned the validity of Bilbo's will. Since much of Bilbo's silverware vanished during his adventure with the Dwarves, when Bilbo left the Shire permanently, he gave Lobelia a box of silver spoons labeled ""For Lobelia, from Cousin Bilbo"", as a mathom.[2] Eventually, Lobelia was able to acquire Bag End when Frodo sold it to her for under market value under his ruse of moving to Crickhollow, but by this time Otho had died and was unable to enjoy it.[3]
During the War of the Ring, Lobelia opposed Sharkey after hearing from the Ruffians that they were ordered to build sheds at Bag End. After rudely telling her to step aside, she became enraged and attacked the leader using only her umbrella as a weapon but she lost and was imprisoned in the Lockholes at Michel Delving.[4] Freed after the Scouring of the Shire, Lobelia was greeted with raucous applause due to her spirit in defying Saruman's thuggery, and she was touched as she had never before been popular due to her avarice. However, she was heartbroken over Lotho's murder, and so granted Bag End back to Frodo and what was left of her money hoping he would use it to help hobbits who had lost their homes, due to Sharkey's tyranny. She moved in with her original family, the Bracegirdles of Hardbottle. She died in the spring of 3020, and was over 100 years old.[5]",

He, like the rest of his family, was very unpopular and generally disliked in the Shire. Like his father and mother, he had always desired Bag End for himself - in the year SR 1418 of Shire Reckoning he had already waited sixty-two years for the inheritance, but was foiled when Bilbo's nephew Frodo Baggins was bestowed the home.
In TA 3012, after Otho had passed away, Lotho came to be considered a wealthy Hobbit through inheriting his father's pipe-weed plantations in the Southfarthing.[1]
In TA 3016 or TA 3017, Lotho began to quietly sell away the best Pipe-weed to Men, using great wagons at Sarn Ford, in exchange for money. Most of these Men were Ruffians in the employ of Saruman. Using this money, Lotho began buying up an excessive amount of property including inns, farms, malt-houses, leaf-plantations, and mills, supposedly including the Old Mill; while he kept his activities a secret, rumors of them inevitably spread throughout the Shire.[1]
In TA 3018, after Frodo sold Bag End to the Sackville-Baggins, Lotho arrived at Bag End with his mother after lunch on September 23 to inspect their new home.[2] A short time after moving into Bag End, Lotho had the Old Mill torn down, hiring outsiders to build a New Mill, bigger than the old one, in addition to other mills under the guise of grinding corn faster. By December, Lotho's trades with outsiders began to include things beyond just Pipe-weed. As a consequence, things began to become scarce as winter came and people started getting angry. To appease them, Lotho came up with an answer to their struggles; he invited some Ruffians among his buyers to stay in the Shire to assert his dominance. Initially, those harmed by the activities of the Ruffians were compensated by Lotho, but soon enough Lotho could not keep up with the Ruffians. After Will Whitfoot, the Mayor of the Shire, decided to journey to Bag End to confront him in protest, Lotho sent his Men to imprison him in the Lockholes.[1]
Not that long within the New Year, Lotho declared himself as the Chief Shirriff, calling himself the Chief. With the aid of Sharkey's Men under his command, the Shire became a totalitarian regime. Lotho restricted the inns to the Ruffians, made a new version of The Rules, and sent his Men to gather goods ""for fair distribution"". While anyone who disagreed with him was sent to the Lockholes, there was resistance to his rule. Fredegar Bolger led a band of rebels in the Brockenbores near the Hills of Scary, though Lotho's Men smoked them out, sending them to the Lockholes.[3] In Tookland, Paladin II Took also resisted and the Tooks hunted any Ruffian Lotho sent there.[1]
Eventually however, Lotho's regime came to an end on September 22[4]  when he was stripped of his power after Saruman came to Bag End under the alias of Sharkey. Lotho was stabbed in his sleep by Gríma at the behest of Saruman (who suggests Gríma may have eaten him as well). Publicly, Lotho simply disappeared from the public eye and his mother was taken to the Lockholes.[1]",

546,"about ,FA 430",FA 495,Male,,,Sador,Men,,None known,"Sador was one of the Drúedain who lived within the household of Húrin.[6] He became a woodman in his youth and learned how to carve and craft things out of wood. When the Dagor Bragollach broke out in the year 455, Sador was called upon from his tasks in the woods to fight. He came too late to the battle field however, only being able to bring back his fallen lord Hador on a bier. Afterwards, Sador become a soldier, thus being stationed at Eithel Sirion for many years with little to mark them. He was there in the year 462 defending Barad Eithel, when Galdor fell and Húrin took up his command, leading them to drive the Orcs back, never coming within sight of Eithel Sirion again. Sometime later, Sador grew tired of war, and obtained leave to return to the woods that he yearned for, becoming a woodman again. Yet tragedy struck when, by ill-luck, he mishandled his axe and accidentally severed his right foot, after which, Sador obtained a crutch and his footless leg had shrunken from a lack of use.[7]
In the years that followed, Sador became a retainer[2] and ""house-man in the service of Húrin"", working in the outbuildings and fixing things, usually of little importance, that were needed in the house, as he still ""had some skill in the working of wood"". During his time within Húrin's household, Sador was befriended by young Túrin, the eldest of the children of Húrin, who would often help Sador by fetching materials and tools to spare him from walking. Sometimes Túrin would bring gifts for him to use that he ""found"" lying around unwatched. As a result, Sador would smile and tell the boy to return them to their proper place, and taught him that he should ""Give with a free hand, but give only your own"". Despite this, Sador often rewarded Túrin's kindness, carving for him the figures of men and beasts, although it was Sador's tales that Túrin delighted the most.[7]
Sador was wise when sharing his tales with Túrin, incorporating many insights about life. When telling Túrin of his time as a soldier, he believed that he could have gotten his injury with more honor during the Dagor Bragollach, and remembered how fiery Húrin was at Eithel Sirion. He then reflected to Túrin that ""a man that flies from his fear may find that he has only taken a short cut to meet it"", as he had fled war only to get an injury during an accident. Túrin often called him Labadal in pity for his accident. As Túrin grew older, however, Sador began to find many of his questions difficult to answer. One such instance occurred after Urwen died from the Evil Breath when Túrin asked him about fate, the difference between Elves and Men, and the nature of death.[7]
On Túrin's eighth birthday in the month of Gwaeron according to the Edain reckoning, Húrin gave him an Elven knife of great worth.[7] Túrin pitied Sador and decided to give the gift to him.[7] Sador accepted the gift as it would be rude not to, but he knew he would be unable to repay Túrin for such a gift.[7] Túrin's mother, Morwen, was not fond of Sador and did not care for him, believing him to be ""self-maimed by his own want of skill"" and ""slow with his tasks"" as well as spending too ""much time on trifles unbidden"". Despite this, however, Túrin noted that his act of generosity resulted in Sador being treated more kindly. Around this time Sador set out to carve a great chair for the hall of Húrin.[8] He was possibly given this task by Húrin instead of choosing to do so of his own accord.[citation needed]
Before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Húrin left to go to war in the month of Lothron.[8] Sador was among ""a few old men and women"" who Morwen still kept as servants, and therefore was not one of the thralls Brodda forced to build his his wooden hall. Sador did not fight in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, though he wished that he did and was dismayed that he could not do so, and ""die a valiant death""[citation needed].[9] When Morwen first told Túrin that he was to go to Doriath, he hoped that Sador could go with him, only for Morwen to say he wouldn’t because it would be ""a hard road"" for him. The next morning, Túrin found Sador preparing to use the unfinished great chair of Húrin as firewood and tried to convince him that Húrin would return and be pleased with the chair. However, Sador explained that ""false hopes"" would not keep them warm in the coming winter. He nonetheless added that the true purpose of the chair was the joy of making it. Sador then talked with him about the necessity of his departure. Túrin was sad but understood. Sador also urged him to take back the Elven knife. Túrin refused, saying that he would get many things like it in Doriath.[10]
Sador stayed in the house of Morwen for a long while, but soon after Morwen and Niënor left to go to Doriath, he became a vagabond to avoid being enslaved by the Easterlings like the rest of the Men of Dor-lómin. Nonetheless, he was often given broth and a place by the fire in Brodda's hall because Aerin somehow forced Brodda to keep ""some of the kindlier manners of old"". Sador was among the vagabonds and servants who believed that Túrin had become ""a king or a lord in some south country"" and had summoned Morwen and Niënor from Dor-lómin.[9]
In the year 496 during the Fell Winter,[11] Sador was resting by the fire in Brodda's hall when a grief-stricken vagabond came to the hall and ""was given a seat by the fire"" and some broth before asking for news of Morwen, shocking Sador and the others by speaking ""the old tongue"". Sador warned him to speak quieter, deducing that he was of the House of Hador. He then revealed all he knew about Morwen, revealed his name, and reminisced on the years before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Upon learning that the other man was Túrin, Sador took him outside the hall and learned that he did not summon Morwen and Niënor. After Sador told him that Aerin might know of Morwen's whereabouts, Túrin re-entered the hall and received answers from Aerin. However, after realizing Glaurung's trickery in sending him there, he killed Brodda and three weaponless Easterlings, instigating a rebellion in the hall. Sador partook in this uprising, but was fatally wounded in the ""great fighting"" that followed. He was, however, able to say his final words to Túrin before perishing, warning him to flee before the Easterlings return with reinforcements.[9]",

Ted Sandyman scoffed at Sam's tales, calling them children's stories. Neither was Ted interested in the news that the Elves were leaving Middle-earth. He questioned the reliability of Sam's sources of information - Bilbo and Frodo Baggins - saying: ""Oh, they're both cracked. Leastways old Bilbo was cracked, and Frodo's cracking.""[1]
When Sam looked at the Mirror of Galadriel, he saw a vision of Ted cutting down trees at the avenue beyond the mill, that shades the road to Bywater. Sam was enraged, wishing he could get at Ted. Sam suspected that there was some devilry at work in the Shire, and exclaimed that he had to go home, but Galadriel said he could not go home alone, and should not blindly trust what he saw in the mirror. Sam reluctantly accepted that, but said ""If what I've seen turn out true, somebody's going to catch it hot!"". The vision Sam saw indeed came true, as revealed in ""Scouring of the Shire"".[2]
After Frodo and Sam left the Shire in September of 3018, Lotho Sackville-Baggins bought the Old Mill and tore it down. He replaced it with an ugly brick building that straddled the river and was full of wheels and strange contraptions to increase production. The next year in September of 3019, Saruman took over operation of the Mill and it was used for some industrial purpose that created noise and pollution.
Ted Sandyman was pleased by these developments and he continued to work in the New Mill. He took orders from the Chief's Men and he participated in the wanton destruction of the Shire by cutting down the trees beyond the Mill that shaded the road to Bywater.
After the Battle of Bywater on November 3, 3019, Frodo and Sam returned to Hobbiton with Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took. They encountered Ted Sandyman at the New Mill. Ted laughed at their dismay at the destruction that had been done to Hobbiton, and he said that if they touched him he would report them to the Chief. When Merry told him that the Chief's Men had been defeated and that the Chief was about to be removed, Ted was shocked.

His reign was without notable events and probably peaceful.

554,"Late ,Third Age",,Male,,,Robin Smallburrow,Hobbits,,,"Robin became Shirriff in TA 3012. Though having joined the Shirriffs earlier than Sharkey's occupation, when questioned by Samwise Gamgee on his role Robin replies that he only applied for the post of Shirriff as a means of wandering the Shire, talking with folks and ""knowing where the good beer was."" Like many Shirriffs during Sharkey's Scouring of the Shire, Robin Smallburrow is forced to continue service against his will as a part of the Shirriff's First Eastfarthing Troop in the town of Frogmorton. However, during the Hobbits uprising against their foreign oppressors, it is assumed that Smallburrow defects in order to help the hobbits.
After Sharkey's demise and the effort and work to return to norm within the Shire, very little is recorded of Smallburrow and his role or family within the Shire, though it is assumed that he, like the hobbits who lived at the start of the Fourth Age, enjoyed the years of plenty and prosperity that dawned over the Shire.

(J.R.R. Tolkien intended to write a story about Tar-Aldarion's daughter Tar-Ancalimë and her cousin Soronto, and how she married only to prevent Soronto from inheriting the throne.)[2]",
556,TA 2922,,Female,Dark,Tall,Morwen Steelsheen,Men,Rohan,Thengel,"Born in TA 2922 of the late-Third Age, Morwen Steelsheen was considerably taller than most of the Men in Middle-earth due to her Dúnedain heritage, a trait that was said to be inherited by a number of her descendants.[1] Morwen lived in Belfalas, of the Prince of Dol Amroth's kin,[2] she was called Steelsheen due to her beauty, grace and pride.[3] She later moved with her family to the flowery vales of Lossarnach. It was there she met Thengel, son of Fengel. Despite being 17 years his junior, Morwen loved him, and they married in TA 2943 and had five children, including Théoden and Théodwyn (mother of Éomer and Éowyn).
While living in Gondor for some time with her family, she moved to Rohan when Thengel became king and became the queen of her husband's country. It is likely Morwen outlived her husband after his death in TA 2980, as the people of Gondor tended to lead longer lives than the Rohirrim, particularly those of pure Dúnedain descent. Despite this, her date of death is not known.",
557,SA 2406,SA 2737,Male,,,Tar-Alcarin,Men,Númenor,Unnamed wife,"Tar-Alcarin was the son of ruling Queen, Tar-Vanimeldë, and her consort, Herucalmo. When his mother died, Tar-Alcarin should have succeeded her, but Herucalmo usurped the throne and held it from him twenty years before he died, and then Tar-Alcarin rightfully gained the throne. He ruled during a period in which there was still peace in Númenor despite the conflicting beliefs of The Faithful and the King's Men which divided its people. However in Middle-earth things were very different, Sauron's power began to grow once again, spreading great fear through the lands near Mordor. Herucalmo's usurpation of his son's legal right to rule the realm was generally considered to be an evil deed by the people.
Tar-Alcarin ruled for eighty years, then was succeeded by his son, Tar-Calmacil but was legally king and ruler of Númenor for the count of one-hundred years.[1][2]",
558,SA 700,SA 1098,Male,,,Tar-Aldarion,Men,Númenor,Erendis,"Tar-Aldarion was called ""The Mariner"", and his name signifies ""of the trees"" because he was a noted tree steward and forester — trees were essential to the construction of his fleets, but he took great care to replenish what was being felled. His first love was the sea, and he was already a great explorer before he became king, founding the Guild of Venturers to promote exploration. He made several journeys to Middle-earth and established contact with Gil-galad in his realm in the Grey Havens making friendship and alliance with him. He also established the first Númenorean port in Middle-earth, named Vinyalonde, built on the river Gwathló, and during his reign the deforesting of Enedwaith and Minhiriath began.[3]
His only child was a daughter, Tar-Ancalimë, so he changed the rules of succession, replacing the principle of agnatic primogeniture with that of fully equal primogeniture. She became the first ruling Queen of Númenor. If not for the change, the throne would have passed to his sister's son Soronto, heir presumptive at the time.
The partial story of Aldarion and Erendis can be found in Tolkien's Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth, (ed. Christopher Tolkien). Though the actual story was left incomplete, the book does give some hints on how it continued. The story also contains the first hints of the return of the Shadow, i.e. Sauron, to Middle-earth.[2][4]",
559,SA 192,SA 603,Male,,,Tar-Amandil,Men,Númenor,Unnamed wife,"Tar-Amandil was actually Númenor's second ruler; his father, Vardamir Nólimon, had declined to take the throne upon the death of his own father, Elros Tar-Minyatur. He abdicated due to advanced age in favor of his son Tar-Amandil but was still by right of succession the ruler, and Vardamir is still counted in the list of kings, making him the second king. Thus, Tar-Amandil was listed as the third King of Númenor. As Vardamir was potentially Half-elven like Elros, Tar-Amandil may have been a Half-elf of the third generation, giving him a slow maturity and long youth like the Elves, while being fated for mortality like Men. He had three children: Tar-Elendil, his eldest son who would succeed him, Eärendur, and a daughter named Mairen.[2]
Tar-Amandil surrendered the Sceptre of Númenor in SA 590 and was succeeded by Tar-Elendil. He died in the year 603 of the Second Age at the age of 411.[1]",
560,SA 1986,SA 2386,Male,,,Tar-Ancalimon,Men,Númenor,Unnamed wife,"During Tar-Ancalimon's reign, the people of Númenor became divided and two opposing parties arose among Númenóreans: the Elf-friends, or Elendili (also called ""The Faithful""), advocated continuing devotion to the Valar and friendship with the Elves, and the ""King's Men"" who opposed the Ban of the Valar and friendship with the Elves, advocating Númenor's independence and self-determination, seeing how they had reached the apex of their might.
During his time, the Elven tongues were discouraged and were no longer taught to Númenórean children. The royal titles however were still taken in Quenya out of respect for ancient customs rather than love for the Eldar. The Great Eagles which had formerly nested in an eyrie in the King's Palace in Armenelos, were no longer fed during his reign and departed. His policies would later contribute to the Fall of Númenor.
Tar-Ancalimon ruled for one-hundred and sixty-five years and was succeeded by his son, Tar-Telemmaitë.[1]",
561,SA 873,SA 1285,Female,,,Tar-Ancalimë,Men,Númenor,Hallacar,"© by Szilvia Szarvas
Tar-Ancalimë was raised by her mother Erendis, and her childhood companion was Zamîn.
She moved to the Númenórean sheep-lands of Emerië where her mother had a house to escape from the many suitors who sought her hand in marriage. There she dwelt for a time, tending sheep, and assuming the name Emerwen Aranel. She received the name after she said that she could not sleep without hearing the sounds of the sheep.
She married the nobleman Hallacar, son of Hallatan of Hyarastorni in SA 1000. Both Tar-Ancalimë and Hallacar were fifth-generation descendants of King Vardamir Nólimon, and the marriage was more one of politics than of love. The Queen aimed to produce an heir in order to secure her throne from her first cousin Soronto. Following the birth of their son, Hallacar and Tar-Ancalimë lived separately.
She was succeeded by her son, Tar-Anárion. She died in year 1285 of the Second Age after a rule of 205 years, at the age of 412 years.[1][2]",
562,SA 1003,SA 1404,Male,,,Tar-Anárion,Men,Númenor,Unnamed wife,"Tar-Anárion succeeded his mother, Tar-Ancalimë in SA 1280. Little is known about Tar-Anárion's rule. His two eldest children were female, but both declined the throne for uncertain reasons, and they disliked and feared Ancalimë, who refused to let them marry. Therefore he was succeeded by his son, Tar-Súrion.[2]",

Tar-Ardamin was the last to follow the practice of using an official Quenya name. His son Ar-Adûnakhôr then abandoned the old traditions, and began officially using the Adûnaic form of his name.",
564,SA 1800,SA 2221,Male,,,Tar-Atanamir,Men,Númenor,Unnamed wife,"Tar-Atanamir succeeded his father, King Tar-Ciryatan, in SA 2029. He was married to an unnamed woman and had a son named Tar-Ancalimon and another unnamed child that eventually led up to Herucalmo.[1][3] Tar-Atanamir began to speak against the Valar in particular the Ban of the Valar and the Gift of Ilúvatar. He was also the first king who was unwilling to give up his throne voluntarily before his death, and to let himself die while he was still strong in mind and body. His reign is thus generally considered to constitute the beginning of Númenor's moral decline.[2]
The Valar were perturbed that the Númenóreans spoke against the Ban of the Valar and sent ambassadors to Tar-Atanamir to attempt to reassure them and halt their growing fear of death. The king demanded to know why his ancestors Eärendil and Tuor lived in Valinor and had eternal life yet he did not. The ambassadors answered that theirs was a fate apart and that the Undying Lands did not themselves make their inhabitants immortal, but were named for those that dwelled in them. Tar-Atanamir was not satisfied with these answers.[2]
He was the first king to refuse to die willingly and give up the Sceptre; death instead took him by force and thus his reign ended. Thus every ruler afterwards did not renounce their reign and accept death before dotage. Tar-Atanamir ruled for one hundred ninety-two years and was succeeded by his son, Tar-Ancalimon.[2] After his death the lifespans of the House of Elros would begin to wane.",
565,SA 2516,SA 2825,Male,,,Tar-Calmacil,Men,Númenor,Unnamed wife,Tar-Calmacil was also as the first king to have recorded an Adûnaic equivalent of his name: Ar-Belzagar.[1] This signified the continuing alienation of the Kings of Númenor and the party of the King's Men from the traditions of friendship with the Elves.,
566,SA 1634,SA 2035,Male,,,Tar-Ciryatan,Men,Númenor,Unnamed wife,"Tar-Ciryatan was born in SA 1634 and was the son of Tar-Minastir. He loved ships and everything connected to ship-lore and ship building. His heart was restless in Númenor and before succeeding his father, he went on many voyages around the world travelling east, north, and south but never west as many yearned to do but never could because of the Ban of the Valar.
He succeeded his father in SA 1869, wresting the Sceptre from him prematurely. Tar-Ciryatan became a mighty king, building great armadas of ships, and the Númenóreans began large-scale colonization of the coasts of Middle-earth, holding the Middle Men in subjugation and demanding great tribute from them. As Tar-Ciryatan was greedy of wealth in these days, he received the pick of the many metals and gems that had been taken by his men in payment or as spoils of war.
He abdicated in SA 2029 after ruling for one-hundred and sixty years, and was succeeded by his son, Tar-Atanamir. He died in SA 2035.[2]",
567,SA 350,SA 751,Male,,,Tar-Elendil,Men,Númenor,Unnamed wife,"His oldest child was Silmariën, a daughter, and his second child was Isilmë, another daughter. Silmariën would have become Queen according to the principle of ""full cognatic primogeniture"". However, the laws dictating succession at the time followed rather the principle known as ""agnatic primogeniture"", preventing women from ruling. Consequently, his third child and oldest son, Tar-Meneldur succeeded him.[1]
Tar-Elendil was the direct ancestor of all subsequent Kings of Númenor through his son. From the time of the reign of Tar-Elendil, the Númenóreans began to make voyages to Middle-earth. It was in SA 600 that Vëantur, the Captain of the King's Ships, sailed from Númenor to Middle-earth for the first time. He surrendered the Sceptre in SA 740 and died in the year 751 of the Second Age, at the age of 401.[1]",
568,SA 543,SA 942,Male,,,Tar-Meneldur,Men,Númenor,Almarian,"Tar-Meneldur succeeded his father, Tar-Elendil, because the rules of succession did not allow women to rule, per the principle of agnatic primogeniture. Had the principle of equal primogeniture been followed instead, the throne would have passed to Silmariën.
Tar-Meneldur married Almarian and had three children: Tar-Aldarion, Ailinel, and Almiel.
During the rule of Tar-Meneldur, contact with the Middle Men of Eriador was reestablished under guidance of the Elves of Lindon under Gil-galad. Tar-Meneldur encouraged the seafarers, and allowed his son Aldarion to establish the Guild of Venturers, which became one of the most powerful organisations in Númenor. Many voyages along the coasts were made at this time, and the first settlements were made in Middle-earth by Númenórean explorers, although none of them permanent yet. These early settlements were however the later cores of Arnor and Gondor, and the re-established contact of Númenóreans with their distant kin allowed the Adûnaic tongue to merge with local, far akin languages, eventually leading to the Westron speech. This would in later years prove to be one of the greatest assets to the power of Númenor in Middle-earth.
Near the end of Tar-Meneldur's rule reports came that evil had begun to stir in the east of Middle-earth (the first awakenings of Sauron, as was later learned), and Gil-galad requested the aid of Tar-Meneldur. Recognizing his son Aldarion was more aware of the troubles, and was a powerful leader of men, Meneldur abdicated in favour of his son far earlier than was expected.
On the family front Meneldur, together with his wife Almarian, attempted to mediate between his son Aldarion and Aldarion's betrothed Erendis, who had become estranged. For a time they were successful, and Aldarion and Erendis were wed, but Aldarion soon left again for sea. It was during his long absence in Middle-earth, a time during which Aldarion was instructed by Gil-galad, that Erendis left the royal court for her home. By the time Aldarion returned even Meneldur's best attempts could not heal the breach.
Meneldur was a lover of star-lore and enjoyed watching their motions. For this purpose he built a tower near the North Cape of Forostar.[3]
Meneldur died in SA 942 after a rule of 143 years, at the age of 399 years.[2]",
569,SA 1474,SA 1873,Male,,,Tar-Minastir,Men,Númenor,Unnamed wife,"Tar-Minastir was the son of Isilmo and succeeded his aunt, Queen Tar-Telperiën, when she died. He was the grandson of King Tar-Súrion. His heart yearned for the west as did many in his time and loved the Elves but envied them. At some point during his rule, he had a great tower built on Oromet so that he could gaze upon the west and dream.
During his rule, Sauron invaded Eriador from Calenardhon in SA 1695 and the realm of Eregion fell. Sauron advanced to Lindon and Rivendell. In SA 1700, Tar-Minastir sent a naval force under the command of Ciryatur to save Lindon. Ciryatur's forces drove Sauron's army back from the Grey Havens and then pursued him to Tharbad, where further Númenórean forces helped defeat Sauron at the Battle of the Gwathló. Battered but not utterly defeated Sauron retreated back to Mordor in SA 1701 swearing revenge.
From Tar-Minastir's reign, the Númenóreans began establishing permanent settlements in Middle-earth.
He abdicated the throne in SA 1869, possibly not entirely willingly, dying peacefully four years later. He was succeeded by his son, Tar-Ciryatan.[1] He reigned for 138 years.",
570,SA 3117,SA 3319,Female,,,Tar-Míriel,Men,Númenor,Ar-Pharazôn,"Zimraphel was born in SA 3117 to Inziladûn (or Tar-Palantir) and was called Míriel in Elvish. Upon a time, she may have been sought after by Elentir, Amandil's brother and Elendil's uncle,[3] but was herself enamored by Pharazôn, her cousin, who was wealthy and highly esteemed. A relationship could have easily arisen between them, as Pharazôn was often abroad, in Númenor's exploits on Middle-earth's coasts.[4]
As the only child of Tar-Palantir, Míriel should have been the Ruling Queen, Pharazôn usurped her throne in SA 3255, becoming Ar-Pharazôn, and married her against her will, reneming her Ar-Zimraphel (as Ruling Queen, she would have preferred the Quenya Tar- and been Tar-Míriel).
Ar-Pharazôn thereafter sailed to Middle-earth upon hearing of the conquests of Sauron, and defeating him, brought him back to Númenor. However, Sauron, in his fair form, corrupted the minds of many Númenóreans, including Ar-Pharazôn and his counselors. The culture of Númenor quickly became eviller, Sauron turning many towards worship of Melkor and the defilement of many good things in the hopes of evading death. Eventually, Ar-Pharazôn became desperate, and Sauron convinced the king to break the Ban of the Valar by sailing to Valinor, saying by this he could gain eternal life.[5] The king amassed the Great Armament in 3319, and embarked westward to attempt this, during which time Tar-Míriel ruled in his absence as Queen Regnant.[6]
For Ar-Pharazôn and his fleet's defiant action, and his setting foot in Valinor, Eru destroyed Ar-Pharazôn and his armada, and rent an enormous chasm under the Sea to destroy Númenor. Amid the tumults, Míriel sighted a giant wave approaching to engulf the city, and attempted to ascend Meneltarma, but was caught by the waters and drowned before reaching the summit, as all of Númenor slid into the depths.[1][5]",
571,SA 3035,SA 3255,Male,,,Tar-Palantir,Men,Númenor,Unnamed wife,"Though Tar-Palantir's father, Ar-Gimilzôr, was an opponent of the Valar and the Elves, his mother Inzilbêth taught Tar-Palantir to be an admirer of the Elves. Even by his enemies he was recognized to be a true seer, prophesying that the fate of the White Tree, Nimloth, was tied to that of the House of Elros.
Ar-Inziladûn took power during a time of great darkness in Númenor; ever since Tar-Atanamir, many kings had spoken against the Valar and turned instead to greed and empire building in Middle-earth. Tar-Palantir, however, sought to repent the actions of his predecessors; he took his regnal name in Quenya, once again tended to the White Tree and followed the ancient practices honoring Eru Ilúvatar. However, there was no response from the Valar, and the view of Tol Eressëa from Tar-Minastir's tower was shrouded.
His daughter, Tar-Míriel was his heir and would have followed his policies, but her rightful place as Queen of Númenor was usurped when she was married forcibly by her cousin, Ar-Pharazôn.[1][2]",

She had little interest in ruling, loving rather culture and the arts such as music and dance, however, and left the day-to-day chores of monarchy to her husband, the nobleman Herucalmo.
Tar-Vanimeldë ruled for 111 years. When she died in SA 2637 at the age of 360 years, the Kingship should have gone to her son, Tar-Alcarin, but Herucalmo usurped the throne and ruled for twenty years as King Tar-Anducal.

He started the construction of Gondor's navies, and became known as the first of the Ship-kings. Under his policies and successful rule, Gondor's extended its power to the west and south of the Mouths of Anduin. He, along with Narmacil I, was one of two childless Kings of Gondor, making him a break-point in the bloodline. Nevertheless his rule was marked by such vigorous naval expansion that at his coronation he assumed the additional regnal name of Falastur, meaning 'Lord of the Coasts'.[2]
The king particularly favored the city of Pelargir, constructing a palace there built out over the Anduin river on arches.
Despite his successes, his reign was troubled by the intrigues of his own wife Queen Berúthiel who spied on everyone within the kingdom. Eventually, he grew tired of her acts, exiling her and her cats to the south.[3] As a result of his wife's exile, he died childless in TA 913, and was succeeded by his nephew Eärnil I.[2]",

The Plague had devastated Gondor, and Tarondor strove to slowly rebuild it and its power. He pursued a policy of strict retrenchment, in which many outposts were abandoned. The most significant event in his reign was the removal of the capital from the now depopulated Osgiliath, to Minas Anor (later known as Minas Tirith) and the replanting of the White Tree. Gondor at this time was drained of its resources and manpower and could no longer afford to tend to the forts guarding the ancient entrances to Mordor. The fortresses were abandoned, paving the way for evil things to return.[3] During his reign, the garrisons and outposts in Enedwaith were also abandoned, with Gondor's western frontier retreating to the Gap of Calenardhon and the White Mountains.

The King of the Dead in the films, portrayed by Paul Norell
In the late Third Age, the king and his people joined with Aragorn and the Grey Company during the War of the Ring, after Aragorn passed through Dwimorberg and summoned them at the Stone of Erech.[1] The Dead Men of Dunharrow then followed Aragorn to Pelargir, where they defeated the Corsairs of Umbar. Aragorn, as Heir of Isildur, subsequently declared the oath of the Dead Men as fulfilled. Upon hearing this, the king broke his spear and threw it aside then bowed to Aragorn, turned away, and with the rest of his people ""vanished like a mist that is driven back by a sudden wind,"" never to be seen again.[2]",

After Fengel died in TA 2953, Thengel was called upon to return to Rohan, which he reluctantly did and succeeded his father as King of Rohan.
During his reign Saruman began to trouble the borders of Rohan with raids, although he did not become known as the culprit until the War of the Ring decades later.
Morwen bore him five children in total (four daughters and a son). His only son (his second child) was called Théoden. One of his daughters was named Théodwyn, who would be the mother of Éomer and Éowyn. Thengel had learned Sindarin while living in Gondor, and in his house it was the daily tongue, together with Westron the common speech. Rohanese was not oft spoken by him, and Westron remained a common tongue at the court of his son and heir Théoden.

Thorin as a prince, portrayed by Richard Armitage
Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet ""Oakenshield,"" which remained with him even in death.[2]
Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850, after his father went missing and died in the dungeons of Dol Guldur.
Quest for the Lonely Mountain
In TA 2941, Gandalf the Grey found Thorin in The Prancing Pony at Bree and set in motion a scheme to retake the mountain. He gave Thorin a map and key that he had received from Thráin in Dol Guldur before he died. Thorin then took a contingent of twelve Dwarves to visit Bilbo Baggins in order to hire him as a burglar for their mission. Thorin intended to infiltrate the Lonely Mountain and retake the treasure from Smaug.[3]

The Dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf encountered many dangers on their journey to the Lonely Mountain, surviving Trolls, Orcs, Wargs, and Spiders. He found the legendary sword Orcrist in a troll-hoard, along with Glamdring.[4] In Rivendell, the Company rested and Elrond translated the Moon-letters on Thrór's Map.[5] During their journey through Mirkwood, Thorin and his Company encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil.[6] They escaped in barrels and traveled down to Lake-town.[7]
Thorin and Company were greeted warmly by the people of Lake-town and hailed as the return of the King under the Mountain.[8] They soon reached the Lonely Mountain and the Dwarves sent Bilbo inside, who conversed with a newly awakened Smaug.[9] Realizing that the Lake-men must have helped the intruders, an enraged Smaug flew towards Lake-town to take revenge. There he was killed by Bard the Bowman, who pierced the bare spot on Smaug's left breast with his black arrow.[10]
Following the death of Smaug, the people of Lake-town asked Thorin for a share of the treasure, as they wanted recompense for the destruction of their home, a part of Smaug's treasure originating from their former city, and because a man of Lake-town who shot the fatal arrow that killed Smaug. Thorin, overwhelmed by greed after recovering his family's riches, and enraged by the presence of Thranduil, refused to share any part of the treasure.[11] Instead, he sent a Raven to seek aid from his relative, Dáin Ironfoot, who sent a force of Dwarven soldiers on the move to secure the reclaimed mountain city.[12] Meanwhile, Thorin charged his companions with looking for the Arkenstone within the hoard of treasure, and gifted Bilbo a mithril shirt for his bravery. However, Bilbo had already found the Arkenstone, and subsequently, brought it to Bard and Thranduil in secret to use as a bargaining counter.[12] When Thorin learned of this, he became enraged and denounced his former companion as a traitor.[13]

The growing conflict over the treasure between Dwarves, Elves, and Men, likely to result in bloodshed, was suddenly averted by the approach of goblin and warg armies, so they instead joined forces to defeat their common enemies in what was later called the Battle of Five Armies. During the battle, Thorin led an assault that proved his strength as a leader, striking out from the mountain and providing vital aid as the goblins threatened to overwhelm his allies. He fought courageously, but was mortally wounded in the battle, requiring Beorn to take him to safety.[13]
Before he died, he made his peace with Bilbo by commending the Hobbit's bravery and good character, apologising for his harsh words as he now recognised his comrade's fundamentally benevolent motives. His last words were, ""If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. But, sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell.""[14]",

During his younger years he saw his people able to finally return to the Lonely Mountain after many years of further exile, and wandering. He himself became a prince with the accession of his father as King under the Mountain, and over all the Longbeards.
During the Great War of the Ring at the age of one hundred fifty-three, Thorin fought the Easterlings in the Battle of Dale, and took refuge in the Lonely Mountain after his father was killed at its gates, along with Brand, the King of Dale. Thorin then became King under the Mountain.
When the news of Sauron's defeat in the South came to the ears of the enemy, they became dismayed and the Dwarves and Men came forth from the mountain and routed them, driving them back to the river Redwater, never troubling them again.[1]
With his father's death, Thorin became king in TA 3019. Thorin III helped rebuild the Lonely Mountain and Dale, and prospered. His realm became a close ally of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor of King Elessar.
During his rule, Gimli, son of Glóin, led a number of Dwarves south to the Glittering Caves, where a new city was settled.

Thranduil was the only son of Oropher, King of the Woodland Realm. He was born during the First Age, and lived in Doriath at some point prior to the Second Kinslaying.[2] At the beginning of the Second Age, some Sindar traveled east and Oropher eventually founded the Elven realm in Greenwood the Great.
In SA 3434, Thranduil and his father fought in the Battle of Dagorlad. Oropher was slain and Thranduil returned to Greenwood with roughly a third of the army that had marched to war.[2] He claimed his inheritance and became King of the Woodland Realm, reigning over the whole of Greenwood the Great.
Third Age[]
The Elvenking, by Ulla Thynell
As the Third Age progressed, however, a sorcerer known as the Necromancer (later revealed to be Sauron returned) took over the abandoned Elven fortress of Amon Lanc and turned it into Dol Guldur. Under his malign influence the Greenwood grew dark, becoming known as Mirkwood, and infested with Orcs and giant spiders. The Wood-elves of Mirkwood were reduced in number and retreated to lands in the north of Mirkwood. By the time of the events of The Lord of the Rings, Thranduil's title was King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood.[3]
In his realm, both Sindarin and Silvan Elvish were spoken,[4] though not all members of his Woodland folk spoke Sindarin.[2]
The Quest of Erebor[]
When Thorin II and company entered northern Mirkwood, the party encountered visions of a feast in the woods, which unknown to them was Thranduil's court.[1] Different members of the party tried to enter the clearing where the feast was being held, but each time darkness would fall and the interrupter fell into a deep sleep. In this manner was Thorin separated from the company, and captured by Thranduil. He provided no information when interrogated, and Thranduil, in turn, sent him to his dungeon ""not too gently, for they did not love Dwarves and thought he was an enemy"".[1] The rest of the party was captured shortly after and brought before Thranduil. When the party proved uncooperative with Thranduil's questioning, he accused them of wandering in his kingdom without leave, interrupting their feast, and stirring up trouble with spiders. They were sent to the dungeon as well, in separate cells and unaware that Thorin was captured.[5]
Thranduil: ""What were you doing in the forest?""Thorin: ""Looking for food and drink, because we were starving.""Thranduil: ""Take him away and keep him safe, until he feels inclined to tell the truth, even if he waits a hundred years.""

Bilbo shows the Arkenstone to the Elvenking and Bard, by Ted Nasmith
After the death of the dragon Smaug, Thranduil supported Bard the Bowman's claim of a share of the treasure the Dwarves recovered from the Lonely Mountain, since Bard was a descendant of Lord Girion of Dale, and the treasure of that town had been taken by Smaug to the Lonely Mountain.[6]
Thranduil led the Elven forces in the Battle of Five Armies. His army was positioned on the southern side of the Mountain, and was the first to charge.[7]
After the battle and Thorin's death, Thranduil took Orcrist, which was previously confiscated in Mirkwood, and laid it upon Thorin's tomb. The treasure was divided among Elves and Men, and Thranduil received the emeralds in the necklace of Girion, which he most desired. Bilbo, Gandalf and Beorn traveled with the Elf-host back to Mirkwood but would not stay in the woods, even when Thranduil asked them to.[8]
When Bilbo and Gandalf bade farewell, Bilbo gave Thranduil a necklace of silver and pearls. The king gave Bilbo the title of ""elf-friend"" and returned with his host to their halls.[8]
War of the Ring[]
During the War of the Ring, he sent his son Legolas to Rivendell, along with other Elves, to report Gollum's escape from Mirkwood.[3] The gradually-established friendship between the Dwarf Gimli and Legolas later helped to reconcile Thranduil's people with the Dwarves.
When the forces from Dol Guldur later attacked Mirkwood, Thranduil repulsed the attack and had the victory. He came into an agreement with Celeborn that the southern part of Mirkwood would be counted as East Lórien. Thranduil took the northern region as far as the Mountains of Mirkwood; the wide forest between Mirkwood and East Lórien was given to the Beornings and the Woodmen of Western Mirkwood. At this time also, Thranduil renamed Mirkwood Eryn Lasgalen, the Wood of Greenleaves.[9]
Fourth Age[]
After the fall of Sauron, Thranduil fixed the southern boundary of his realm as the Mountains of Mirkwood, and his realm flourished well into the Fourth Age.[9] He may have stayed on as the king of the Great Forest or left Middle-earth and departed to the Undying Lands.",

595,TA 2644,TA 2850,Male,,,Thráin II,Dwarves,Lonely Mountain,Unnamed wife,"Early life[]
Thráin was born in the Lonely Mountain to Thrór, who was King under the Mountain. He married sometime before TA 2746 and had three children: Thorin, Frerin, and Dís.
Life in exile[]
Thráin fled Erebor with his father, his three children, and the surviving Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain when the dragon Smaug descended on the mountain in TA 2770, desolating the kingdom and claiming its treasure. Exiled, he and his relatives wandered farther south, and they eventually settled in the hills of Dunland. They would remain in Dunland for twenty years, reduced to poverty.
Years after the destruction of Erebor, poverty took a toll on the mind of King Thrór, rendering him restless and desperate. He sought to journey away searching for a scrap of wealth, though he did not specify Moria. At their parting, he gave to his son Thráin his Ring of power and the Map and Key to the Side-door of the Lonely Mountain. He departed from his people with a single companion, his only and old friend named Nár.
War of the Dwarves and Orcs[]

Nár would return to their dwelling in Dunland many weeks later, but he would return alone. He told the tale to Thráin of what had become of his father Thrór, who had brashly ventured into Moria, despite the pleas of Nár not to go in, but he did not return. Days later, it was revealed that the King had been branded and murdered by Azog the Orc, who claimed to now rule the ancient mansions of Durin's Folk.
When Thráin heard Nár's recounting of what had become of his father and that an Orc was ruling their ancestral home, he wept and tore his beard and then fell silent. For seven days, he sat and said no word. However, on the seventh day, he stood up and declared, ""This cannot be borne!"" These words were the beginning of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.

Thráin sent messengers to deliver the tale to all the corners of the world. Word was sent to all the Houses of the other Dwarven Fathers. The kings of the other Houses answered to Thráin's call to vengeance, as they all saw this heinous deed committed by Azog to be a profound dishonor to the heir of the eldest of their race, and it raised their fury. While most of the war was fought in the mines and tunnels beneath the Misty Mountains, the climactic Battle of Azanulbizar took place beneath the East-gate of Moria in the valley of Azanulbizar. Heavy losses were inflicted on both sides. Frerin, the younger brother of Thorin Oakenshield, was among those that fell. Thráin himself had been wounded in the battle and suffered a grievous eye-wound. The tide of war, at last, turned when fresh reinforcements from the Iron Hills arrived late. Realizing that his hordes were being annihilated and routed by the Dwarves, Azog turned and attempted to flee back to the gate but was slain by Dáin Ironfoot, bringing about an end to the war.
Later life and capture[]
Afterward, Thráin led the remainder of his people – among them his eldest son Thorin Oakenshield – back to Dunland, where they dwelt for a while. Eventually, they relocated to the northern Blue Mountains, where they made their dwelling. After some time, they showed signs of prosperity, and their numbers slowly began to increase.
Many years later, Thráin grew older, and he became restless, fed by the Ring of Power in his possession.[1] His desire to reclaim his kingdom of the Lonely Mountain grew. In TA 2841, he and a group of followers, including Balin and Dwalin, left their dwelling in the Blue Mountains and journeyed into Wilderland. The servants of Sauron pursued them, and one morning in TA 2845, in the eaves of Mirkwood, his companions awoke to find that Thráin was missing. They searched in vain for him for days, but he could not be found at all. It was later learned that he had been captured and imprisoned in the pits of Sauron's stronghold of Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood. There he was tortured, and Sauron took from him the last of the Dwarven Rings of Power and left him there to die.[1][2]

Before Thráin's death – while on a mission to Dol Guldur – Gandalf the Grey came upon Thráin and was given the map and key made by his father, Thrór. Thráin appeared so diminished that he had forgotten almost everything, including his name. Gandalf promised to deliver it to Thorin but could not confirm that this Dwarf was, in fact, Thráin due to Thráin's loss of memory. There he died.[3]
Legacy[]
Years later, Gandalf met with Thorin near the village of Bree. There, Gandalf promised to help Thorin on his quest to reclaim Erebor. The most notable way Gandalf helped was when he invited the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins on the journey to act as the company's burglar.
Several decades later, during the Council of Elrond, Glóin revealed that part of Balin's motivation for attempting to re-enter Moria was to find the last Dwarven Ring of Power, which was last seen in Thrór's possession. Gandalf regretfully informed them that Thrór had passed the ring to Thráin, and when Thráin was captured in Dol Guldur, the ring was stripped from his possession. Glóin mourned this loss, wondering aloud when, if ever, the Dwarves would have their vengeance against the Dark Lord Sauron.",

In TA 2589, when their halls came under attack by Cold-drakes, his father Dáin I and younger brother Frór were both slain at their gates by a great Cold-drake, and Thrór inherited the kingship. He and his youngest brother Grór resolved to divide their folk: Thrór led a small portion of Durin's Folk to recolonize Erebor, taking the Arkenstone with him. Grór led the other portion of Durin's Folk further east to the Iron Hills where he founded his realm.[1]
Thrór sitting on his throne with the Arkenstone
Under Thrór's leadership, Erebor prospered for over a century. Eventually, the wealth of the kingdom attracted the attention of the dragon Smaug, who flew south and assaulted and destroyed the kingdom, killing hundreds of Dwarves and driving away Thrór and his family, as well as thousands of other survivors. The majority of the survivors migrated to the Iron Hills, but some followed King Thrór, his son Thráin II, and grandson Thorin Oakenshield westward into a long, homeless wandering. They eventually settled in the hills of Dunland, and made a sufficient living there.[1]
Twenty years later in TA 2790, Thrór now old, poor, and desperate, gave to his son Thráin II the last of the Seven Rings, a key and map of the Lonely Mountain. He then left his people and journeyed away north with a single companion called Nár. They crossed over the Misty Mountains through the Redhorn Pass and then came south again, crossing the Silverlode into the valley of Azanulbizar beneath the East-gate of Moria. When they arrived, the gate was open. Nár begged Thrór to beware but, Thrór disregarded his pleas and proudly entered Moria as its returning heir, but he did not come back.[1]
Nár waited and hid nearby for many days. One day he heard a great shout, followed by the blast of a horn, and a body was flung out onto the steps. It was indeed the body of Thrór, as Nár had feared. Then a voice called out to him from just inside the gate. Rather than being killed as well, Nár was instead made use of as a messenger. He was told to deliver a warning that 'beggars' who would not wait at the doors but instead entered to attempt thieving, would meet a similar fate. Nár was told to bring this message back to his people. But that was not all: the voice proclaimed that he now ruled Moria, and if any wanted to know who was king, he had written his name on the beggar's face. Thrór's head lay severed next to his body. Nár turned it over and found branded across the forehead, written in Dwarven runes, a name that would be branded in the hearts of all Dwarves: Azog. He was barred from retrieving the head of Thrór and was struck with a pouch containing a few coins of little worth, which Azog referred to as a 'fee', but it was meant as a final insulting gesture. Nár took the pouch and fled down the Silverlode. When he looked back, Orcs had emerged from the gate and were hacking apart Thrór's body and flinging the pieces to the black crows.[1]
This was the tale that Nár brought back to Thráin II when he returned to Dunland weeks later. After seven days of sitting in silent grief, Thráin at last stood up and declared that this atrocity would be answered. This was the beginning of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, although it took up to three years for the Dwarves to gather their full forces. The war culminated with the Battle of Azanulbizar, which, though costly, was won by the Dwarves, and Dáin Ironfoot, son of Náin, beheaded Azog and mounted the Orc's head on a stick. The pouch of coins originally flung at Nár was stuffed into Azog's mouth.[1]

Théoden was the only son of Thengel, and became king after the death of his father in TA 2980. Théoden spoke Sindarin and Westron more often than Rohanese, due to the influence of his father, and spent a part of his youth growing up in the mountain vales of Gondor, his mother's homeland.[1]
His sister Théodwyn lived with him in Edoras, and after she and her husband both died he adopted her children Éomer and Éowyn as his own. He had a son Théodred, whose mother, Elfhild, died at childbirth.[1]
War of the Ring[]
By the time of the War of the Ring, Théoden had been king for nearly 40 years, and was becoming old and tired. He was increasingly misled by his chief adviser Gríma (or Wormtongue as most others in the Mark called him), who was secretly in the employ of Saruman the White. Gríma may even have been poisoning Théoden. In the last years before the War of the Ring, Théoden let his rule slip out of his hands, and Gríma gained an increasingly large hold over him. Rohan had been troubled by Orcs and Dunlendings since the time of his father and now by the new fighting Uruk-hai, who operated under the will of Saruman, ruling from Isengard.[3]

When Théoden's son Théodred was mortally wounded at the First Battle of the Fords of Isen with the Orcs of Saruman, his nephew Éomer became his heir. Éomer however fell out of favor with Wormtongue and was placed under arrest.
Théoden upon reclaiming his sword, Herugrim
When Gandalf the White, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli appeared before him, Théoden initially rebuked Gandalf's advice to resist Saruman, but after being released from the effects of Gríma, he commanded Háma to release his nephew and bring him his sword. Théoden, under advice from Gandalf, advanced to face the invasion by the forces of Saruman. However on meeting Ceorl on the road and realising the strength of Isengard he rode instead to the fortress of the Hornburg, and shortly thereafter successfully defended the keep at the Battle of the Hornburg despite overwhelming odds. After this, he became known as Théoden Ednew, the Renewed, because he had thrown off the yoke of Saruman.
Following the battle, Théoden came with Gandalf to the ruins of Isengard, where he met Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took. He soon had favor for Merry, and expressed great interest in hearing more about the Shire, especially Hobbit lore surrounding pipe-weed. Riding to Dunharrow by mountain paths, Théoden arrived to find the muster of the Rohirrim in full swing. That night, errand riders from Gondor arrived and presented him with the Red Arrow, a symbol of dire need and summons to fulfill the Oath of Eorl.
Théoden then led six thousand Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, bravely charging the legions of Sauron, where he won great glory by defeating a chieftain of the Southrons along with the bearer of a banner depicting a black serpent.[5]

He challenged the Witch-king of the nine Ringwraiths, and was mortally wounded when his horse Snowmane fell upon him after being spooked by the Witch-king's winged steed. He was quickly protected by Éowyn and Merry, both of whom had ridden to war in secret.[5]
Théoden's wounds were mortal and he perished on the Pelennor Fields. His body was preserved in the Hallows of Minas Tirith until Éomer returned with a cortege. Théoden was then buried in the Barrowfield outside Edoras, the last king of the second line.[6]
After his death, the Rohirrim minstrel Gléowine composed a song for him and the other Kings of Rohan.[6]
Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising
he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.

out of loss, out of life, unto long glory.

War of the Ring
Fellowship of the Ring
While on their way to Buckland, Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and Peregrin Took encountered a Black Rider, who was warded off by the presence of a company of Elves, led by Gildor Inglorion.[5] Meriadoc Brandybuck later joined them once they reached Buckland. They were waylaid by Old Man Willow in the Old Forest,[6] and Tom Bombadil rescued them and took them into his house.[7] On the way to Bree, Pippin was caught up with the Barrow-wights on the Barrow-downs. After the encounter, Pippin acquired a Dagger of Westernesse.[8]
In The Prancing Pony, Frodo accidentally slipped the One Ring upon his finger, drawing the attention of the Black Riders.[9] Their group met a Ranger of the North, Strider. The inn was attacked by the Nazgûl at night, and the four hobbits were successfully led away by Strider, whose real name was Aragorn.[10]
Aragorn led them to Weathertop, where the group was once again attacked by the Black Riders.[11] In haste to get an injured Frodo to Rivendell, the Elf-lord Glorfindel arrived and guided them.[12]
After the Council of Elrond, Pippin and Merry were allowed by Elrond to join the Fellowship of the Ring.[13]
In Moria, Pippin thoughtlessly dropped a stone down a well, which roused goblins in various caverns and revealed the Fellowship's presence to them. It incurred Gandalf's wrath, and he called Pippin a ""fool of a Took"". The battle of the Chamber of Mazarbul followed.[14]
Pippin and Merry in Fangorn Forest, by Raoul Vitale
Capture by the Uruk-hai
In the Skirmish at Amon Hen, Pippin and Merry were protected by Boromir, who was killed in the process. The two hobbits were taken away by the Uruk-hai, mistaking them to be the Ring-bearer.[15] On their way to Isengard, Pippin dropped the Elven-brooch he received from Lothlórien, as a sign for Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, who were in pursuit.
When a company of the Rohirrim ambushed the Uruk-hai,[16] Pippin and Merry were able to escape into Fangorn Forest, where they meet the Ent Treebeard. They both drank Ent-draughts during their time in Fangorn, which increased their heights substantially.[17] Pippin and Merry eventually befriended Treebeard and told him what had happened to them. After the Entmoot, the Ents decided to march against Isengard.[18] Pippin and Merry were reunited with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf after Isengard's destruction.[19]
Guard of the Citadel
In Orthanc, Pippin picked up Saruman's palantír, which Gríma Wormtongue threw. As he looked into the stone, Pippin had a first-hand encounter with Sauron himself, leading the Dark Lord to assume Pippin was the Ring-bearer. Gandalf and Pippin then rode on Shadowfax to Gondor, for the latter's protection from Sauron's forces.[20] Pippin met Denethor II, the Ruling Steward of Gondor and Boromir's father. In recompense for Boromir's death, Pippin pledged his allegiance to Denethor and became a Guard of the Citadel.[21]

While in Minas Tirith, Pippin befriended Beregond, a fellow Guard of the Citadel, his son Bergil, and Faramir, Boromir's younger brother. During the Siege of Gondor, Pippin witnessed Denethor preparing a pyre in the Hallows for himself and an unconscious Faramir. Pippin quickly went out in search for Gandalf, with whom he was able to save Faramir from being burned to death. Denethor, however, burned to death in the pyre he had made.[22]
Last days of the war
Pippin was among the army of the West, which was led by Aragorn. They assaulted the Black Gate to divert the attention of Sauron and give Frodo enough time to destroy the Ring. In the Battle of the Black Gate, Pippin managed to kill one of the Olog-hai, a troll-race bred by Sauron, the first hobbit ever to do so. He was knocked unconscious when the troll fell on him. Gimli later recognized the Hobbit feet under the Troll and brought him to the healers, saving his life.[23] After his coronation, King Elessar knighted him and granted him and his fellow hobbits leave to return home, as well as leave to return to Gondor whenever they liked. Later, he, Merry, Frodo, and Sam were instrumental in overthrowing the small remainder of Saruman's forces during the Scouring of the Shire.[24]
After the war
In the year FO 6 of the Fourth Age Pippin married Diamond of Long Cleeve, when she was 32 and he himself was 37. They had one son, Faramir Took, who later married Samwise Gamgee's daughter Goldilocks Gardner.[25]
In the year FO 13, Pippin became the 32nd Shire-thain, a position he held for fifty years before renouncing it in FO 63, when he revisited Rohan and Gondor with Merry. He remained in Gondor for the rest of his life.[25]
Pippin died some time after the year FO 63 and was laid to rest with Merry in Gondor. After the great King Elessar died in FO 120, Merry and Pippin were entombed next to him.",

Tuor was born in FA 472 after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, in which his father Huor died. After hearing that the battle was lost, Rían fell into despair and left Dor-lómin while still pregnant with Tuor. She would have been lost and died if not for the Sindar Elves of Mithrim who rescued her and took her to their home in the Mountains of Mithrim. Tuor was soon born and first fostered by the Grey-elves. Later, their leader Annael told his mother that Huor had perished in the battle. She soon fell into grief in her early twenties and went to Haudh-en-Ndengin, the Hill of the Slain and seeing the mounds of rotting and despoiled remains, she fell sick and died.
When the Easterlings came to claim their reward for aiding Morgoth in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, they occupied Hithlum and captured its people as their slaves. The Sindar moved their camp into the caves of Androth and it was there that Tuor spent his youth. In his sixteenth year, he grew angry with the Easterlings and their allies for the evil deeds they had done to his people and wished to fight them. Annael forbid this and Tuor obeyed. When the Elven group intended to move to the safer havens in the Mouths of Sirion through the Gate of the Ñoldor, Tuor went with them but the group came under attack by Orcs and scattered during the night. Tuor was captured and sent to the Easterlings and sold into slavery.
A thrall in Hithlum[]
Tuor served the Easterling chief, the brutal Lorgan, who had been sent there by Morgoth and who cruelly oppressed the remnant of the House of Hador. He worked as a thrall for three years, at which point he had grown to his full stature, and became taller and swifter than any of the Easterlings.

Wanderings[]
Tuor then escaped, and lived the life of an outlaw. He travelled through Hithlum to the Cirith Ninniach, and then to the Annon-in-Gelydh. At the Gate of the Ñoldor, he met two Ñoldorin Elves, Gelmir and Arminas, who showed him the way into Nevrast. He spent the rest of the year in Nevrast, until he saw seven swans, and took it as a sign that he had tarried too long. He followed these swans down the coast until he reached the ruins of Vinyamar, the previous home of Turgon and his people. There he found a set of armour left behind by Turgon and putting these on, made his way down to the sea where a great storm was raging.
At this point, the Vala Ulmo, Lord of Waters, emerged from the Belegaer and appeared to Tuor, bestowing upon him a great cloak to shield him from the eyes of his enemies, and a quest to remind Turgon of the Doom of the Ñoldor, and to warn him of the Fall of Gondolin. He also found Voronwë, an Elf of Gondolin, who had been a mariner on the last attempted Ñoldorin voyage to Valinor, saved from the wrath of Ossë by Ulmo for the purpose of guiding him to Gondolin.
Tuor and Voronwë then travelled through the Fell Winter past the Pools of Ivrin, where they caught a glimpse of Tuor's cousin, Túrin, wielding Gurthang, and making his way towards the wastes of Dor-lómin.

Life in Gondolin[]
Tuor's coming to Gondolin, by Ted Nasmith
Passing through the Fell Winter, Tuor and Voronwë eventually arrived in Gondolin in FA 496. Upon arriving, he proclaimed to have been sent from Ulmo with a message to Turgon. Seeing Tuor arrayed in the devices of Ulmo, he was immediately taken to see the king, where he delivered Ulmo's warning to depart; that Morgoth was coming ever closer to discovering the location of Gondolin. However, Maeglin argued against Tuor and Turgon became conflicted. For he had grown to greatly love his city, which was by now as fair as Tirion itself, and he trusted still in it's secrecy and strength. As such, he did not evacuate as Ulmo advised. However, he did not wholly disregard the wisdom of Ulmo, and decreed that none should ever pass out of the Hidden City again. He ordered the passage through the Encircling Mountains to be sealed up, and as such Tuor was forced to remain in Gondolin, though he did so gladly. Tuor rose quickly in honor in the city, being of great stature both physically and spiritually and having had the privilege of conversing directly with Ulmo. Seven years after arriving in Gondolin, Tuor fell in love with King Turgon's Elven daughter, Idril Celebrindal, who loved him in return. Turgon, who already considered Tuor as close as kin, gave the couple his blessing. They were wed in a celebration of great happiness, and soon after, their only child Eärendil the Mariner was born, who himself became the father of Elrond and Elros.
As told in The Book of Lost Tales Part Two, the Elves in Gondolin treated Tuor very highly: ""Upon a time the king caused his most cunning artificers to fashion a suit of armour for Tuor as a great gift, and it was made of Ñoldorin steel overlaid with silver, but his helm was adorned with a device of metal and jewels like two swan-wings, one on either side, and a swan's wing was wrought on his shield"". ""A house was built for him upon the southern walls, for he loved the free airs and liked not the close neighborhood of other dwellings. There it was his delight often to stand on the battlements at dawn, and folk rejoiced to see the new light catch the wings of his helm.""[1]
Tuor with the other Lords of Gondolin, by Kazuki Mendou
Tuor was one of the leaders of Gondolin in the Fall of Gondolin, and defended the city against the attack by the forces of Morgoth. He achieved meritorious deeds including forcing a fire-drake to retreat. He also stopped an attack on his wife and son by Maeglin, who he was able to thwart by throwing him from the walls, mirroring the fate of his father Eöl. Afterwards he, his wife, their son Eärendil, and a remnant of Gondolin's people escaped through a secret way in the mountains and traveled to the Mouths of Sirion. Longing for the sea, Tuor eventually built the ship Eärrámë and sailed into the West with Idril.
Despite his human state of mortality, the tradition of the Ñoldor was that when Tuor arrived with Idril in Valinor he became the only Man to be accepted as one of the elder kindred, and thus shared with Beren and Lúthien, who were also granted a second life in Middle-earth, the exceptional fate of an immortal life in Valinor as long as Arda endured. Whether Eärendil ever found or saw his parents again is not known.[2][3]

In Eldamar, Turgon was friendly with the sons of Finarfin and opposed Fëanor's plan to pursue Morgoth after the theft of the Silmarils, but eventually he chose to follow them to Middle-earth and became one of the exiles. His wife Elenwë was lost crossing the Helcaraxë,[2] but Turgon and his daughter Idril came to Nevrast, where he built Vinyamar and gathered to him one-third of the Ñoldor of Fingolfin and a large number of Sindar.[3]
In the year 50 of the First Age, Turgon was instructed by Ulmo to prepare a secret kingdom and was shown the hidden Vale of Tumladen in the Encircling Mountains. After 52 years of secret labor, Turgon led his people into Gondolin, where he ruled for over 500 years, largely ignoring the events of the Wars of Beleriand.[4][5]
About two hundred years after Gondolin was wrought, Turgon's sister Aredhel journeyed to meet with the Sons of Fëanor. She was lost, however, and returned with her son Maeglin a few years later. After the deaths of both Eöl and Aredhel, Turgon took Maeglin under his wing and made him the Lord of the House of the Mole. Maeglin secretly loved Turgon's daughter Idril, who rejected his advances.[6]
Aside from the misadventure of Eöl, the splendor of Turgon's reign in Gondolin was undisturbed until the Dagor Bragollach, when Turgon was brought his father's body by Thorondor. Two years later Thorondor brought him Húrin and Huor, whom he fostered for a year and then allowed to return to Dor-lómin. At this time, Turgon foresaw the doom of the Ñoldor, and he secretly sent mariners to try to obtain the mercy of the Valar.[7] None of these missions was successful and only one of the mariners, Voronwë, survived the Shadowy Seas paving the way for Tuor's coming to Gondolin.[8]

Turgon joined the Union of Maedhros with an army ten thousand strong and fought alongside his brother Fingon in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, but the sacrifice of Húrin, Huor, and the Third House of the Edain enabled him to retreat without revealing the location of Gondolin.[9] When Tuor came to Gondolin in FA 496, Turgon welcomed him, but in his pride, he refused to follow the advice of Ulmo to flee to the Havens of Sirion. The full malice of Morgoth was now directed toward Turgon, the last of the House of Finwë to control a realm in Middle-earth. At last, aided by the treachery of Maeglin, Morgoth discovered the location of Gondolin, and Turgon was slain defending the city.[10]

Urwen was loved more than Túrin, who did not speak often and seemed older than his years. However, she died in childhood of a plague and Morwen forbade Túrin from speaking Urwen's nickname. Túrin became a close friend of Sador the one-legged carpenter, whom he named Labadal (""hop-a-foot""). On the morning of Túrin's eighth birthday, his father gave him an Elf-wrought knife, but he gave it to Sador. After Húrin was captured in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Túrin remained with his mother Morwen, who hid him from the Easterlings that Morgoth had sent to Hithlum, fearing they would kill Túrin or enslave him. Unknown to Túrin at that time, Morgoth had placed a curse on all of Húrin's family.

Time in Doriath[]
When Túrin was eight years old, Morwen decided to send him to the Elven realm of Doriath. Before his departure, Sador offered him to give him his blade back, but he refused. After travelling to Doriath with Gethron and Grithnir, he was found by Beleg, who gave food to him, and was adopted by Thingol as a son after meeting the Elf-maiden Nellas in the woods. After this, Túrin's second sister Niënor was born. Túrin was restless, and as soon as he was permitted he joined Beleg Cúthalion on the marches of Doriath, fighting the Orcs of Morgoth. It was in this time he received the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin from Thingol. In his early battles his helm protected him from many injuries, as he was inexperienced in warfare. The helm was an heirloom of the House of Hador and because of it the Orcs feared him above all others.

Life as an outlaw[]
Túrin accidentally caused the death of Saeros, one of Thingol's counsellors who provoked and attacked him. Before he could be either punished or forgiven for it, he fled, eventually encountering a band of outlaws that dwelt south of Brethil. With them, he identified himself only as Neithan (""the wronged""). The men of the band realized he was by far more skilled than themselves, so they accepted him. Túrin slew their leader after seeing him terrorize a woman, and became the outlaws' leader in his place. As leader, he stopped the band from raiding houses of free folk, and directed them to only assail Orcs.
In the meantime, Beleg Cúthalion obtained leave from Thingol to seek out his friend. In FA 487, Beleg found Túrin's outlaws at the outskirts of Amon Rûdh and was held and tied up by them until Túrin returned. Andróg, who was a prominent member of the group, mistrusted Beleg even after Túrin declared him a friend and begrudged him Túrin`s friendship. Beleg tried to persuade Túrin to return to Doriath, for the king held that he was innocent. When Beleg could not persuade his friend to leave the outlaws, he left to return to Doriath. Túrin's band later captured Mîm the Petty-dwarf while Beleg and Túrin were parted. Mîm was forced to share his halls on Amon Rûdh with his company while Túrin promised to repay Mîm for the accidental death of his son Khîm.
Death of Beleg[]
At Doriath, Beleg asked to be able to join his friend. Thingol allowed this and also gave him the sword Anglachel, and Thingol's wife Melian gave him Lembas. Beleg returned to Túrin that winter, healing those of the band that had become sick with cold. Beleg brought with him the Dragon-helm, after Túrin agreed to take the Dragon-helm, the area around Amon Rûdh became known as Dor-Cúarthol, ""The Land of Bow and Helm"" (since Beleg was known as a mighty bowman). There Túrin took the name Gorthol, ""The Dread Helm"". Many warriors joined them, and much of the west of Beleriand was freed from evil for a while. Mîm, however, was greatly jealous of Beleg's friendship with Túrin.
The death of Beleg, by Elena Kukanova
Eventually, Túrin was betrayed by Mîm the dwarf. He allowed a pack of Orcs to have information with which they could destroy the company, as long as he was allowed to kill Beleg himself. Túrin was captured at the top of Amon Rûdh and all his men were slain about him. Beleg was saved by Androg who drove Mím away and then cut Beleg's bonds with his last action before dying. Beleg then rescued Túrin from the Orcs in Taur-nu-Fuin with the help of Gwindor, an escaped slave of Morgoth, but Túrin accidentally killed Beleg with the sword Anglachel, for Beleg, who was trying to cut Túrin's bonds, was mistaken by Túrin as one of the Orcs tormenting him. Gwindor and Túrin then fled the others, and as Túrin's mind was lost in a silent sadness, Gwindor led him to the Pools of Ivrin, where Túrin then cried and his madness was cured.

Leader of Nargothrond[]
Gwindor then led Túrin to Nargothrond, where once he had lived. In Nargothrond, Túrin hid his name, calling himself by the alias Agarwaen son of Úmarth (Sindarin for ""Bloodstained son of Ill-fate""), while hoping to hide his identity and escape Morgoth's curse upon his kin. He had Anglachel re-forged and named it Gurthang, ""Iron of Death"". Finduilas, daughter of Orodreth, fell in love with him, but he avoided her because she had previously been the beloved of his friend Gwindor. Túrin declined to tell her his name, so that she called him Thurin (the secret). He was also called Adanedhel (Man-Elf) because he was so like an elf, though he was human. Gwindor later revealed Túrin's true identity to Finduilas when anger and sadness over took him and it eventually reached Finduilas' father, King Orodreth.
The revelation of his identity resulted in Túrin becoming a chief counsellor of Orodreth, and was extremely influential in Nargothrond. He encouraged the Nargothrondrim to abandon their practice of secrecy, and they built a great bridge before the gates. Because of his prowess with Gurthang, he himself became known as the Mormegil (Black Sword), or the Black Sword of Nargothrond. In FA 495, with Orodreth now deep in the council of Túrin, the Elves of Nargothrond marched out from their secret city with an army of some thousands of Elves to confront the enemy massing beneath the Ered Wethrin (Mountains of Shadow) and in the Pass of Sirion. They were overwhelmed and driven into the Plain of Tumhalad and utterly defeated in the Battle of Tumhalad. Only Túrin, who wore the Dragon Helm of Dor-lómin was able to survive the hot fiery blasts of Glaurung and escaped. There was a desperate attempt to destroy the bridge Túrin has ordered to be built for swifter actions of the army, alas it was too well made and the enemy arrived and Glaurung the father of dragons destroyed the gate and the sacking of the once mighty Nargothrond, began.
The dragon's deceit[]
Túrin and Níniel in Brethil, by Gustavo Malek
Túrin was caught by the powerful gaze of Glaurung at the smashed gate of the city, and stood by idly as Finduilas and hundreds of captives were dragged away. Finduilas called to him, but her cries were drowned out by the distance. Túrin was released from Glaurung's spell, which deceived Túrin into believing Morwen and Niënor were suffering in Dor-lómin, and Túrin abandoned Finduilas to seek them out. In actuality, Morwen and Niënor were safely in Doriath, as Túrin's own efforts had made the way passable.
""Túrin the Silent"", by Jay Johnstone
Once in Dor-lómin, Túrin found his old home empty. He went to the halls of the Easterling lord Brodda, who had taken Húrin's kinswoman Aerin as a wife and many a time beaten her and enslaved Túrin's people, Brodda had also taken Húrin's lands and possessions to which also rightfully belonged to Túrin. From Aerin, Túrin learned that Morwen had left, and in his rage, he held Brodda up like a dog and threw him in a group of men, breaking Brodda’s neck and killing him, thereby also sealing Aerin's fate. As Túrin left again, Aerin burnt herself alive in Brodda's halls, and the remainder of the House of Hador now was persecuted even more cruelly. There he also met Sador once again before he died, adding to the list of people whose lives his rash actions had ended.
Túrin next tried to find Finduilas, but when he had picked up the Orcs' trail, woodsmen of Brethil informed him she had been killed as they had tried to rescue the prisoners of Nargothrond. Túrin collapsed on the mound she was buried in, and was brought to Brethil.
In Brethil, Túrin renamed himself Turambar (Master of Doom) in an act of bravado, deciding that his curse was finally over. One night in the middle of a fierce storm he and his men found a naked young woman on Finduilas's grave, and called her Níniel ""Maiden of tears"" due to her crying, for she knew nothing. Túrin years later took her as his wife. Túrin did not know that this was indeed his sister, whose memory had been erased by Glaurung. Brandir, out of jealousy or forecast, told Níniel that a shadow was cast above Túrin, and that instead of being Master of Shadow, the Shadow would inevitably master him.

Slayer of Glaurung[]
Glaurung's death, by John Howe
Túrin's happiness ended when Glaurung came near Brethil, burning miles and miles of forest so that he could reach where the woodsmen lived. Túrin with two others set out to kill the dragon, but he was the only one to reach the drake. Darlas, being too cowardly, abandoned Túrin, but Hunthor the faithful went on. As Túrin passed underneath the dragon, he nearly toppled into the waters due to the dragon's stench had it not been for Hunthor, who steadied him. Unfortunately, as a result of this action, a stone moved by Glaurang's passing hit Hunthor on the head, and he fell into the ravine. With his black sword and bitterness in his heart, Túrin then stabbed the dragon's belly with all his hatred and power; killing Glaurung at Cabed-en-Aras, but as he retrieved his sword the foul blood of the Dragon fell on his hand and he was hurt and fell in a swoon. As Níniel came to search for him, Glaurung with his last words revealed to her that she was Turin's sister. Horrified, and believing Túrin dead, Niënor Níniel killed herself by leaping into the ravines of the river.
Death[]
Níniel finds Túrin after the slaying of Glaurung, thinking he is dead - by Vigshane
When Túrin awoke he was told by Brandir the Lame, lord of the Haladin of Brethil what had happened. In anger, he killed Brandir in front of many people, refusing to believe the truth. When he learned from Mablung of Doriath, who had come to seek him, that Brandir was telling truth and that he had wrongfully slain him, Túrin could no longer live with the pains and misfortunes of his life and determined to commit suicide. Just before his death, he revealed that he had been 'blind'; Morgoth's curse had had him groping in the dark since childhood.
Then, Túrin said to Gurthang: ""Hail Gurthang, iron of death, thou alone now remainest! But what lord or loyalty dost thou know, save the hand that wieldeth thee? From no blood wilt thou shrink! Wilt thou take Tùrin Turambar? Wilt thou slay me swiftly?""
Túrin kneeling at Cabed Naeramarth, in dialogue with his sword, by Ted Nasmith
And from the blade rang a cold voice in answer: ""Yea, I will drink thy blood, that may I forget the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I will slay thee swiftly."" Then Tùrin set the hilts upon the ground, and cast himself upon the point of Gurthang, and the black blade took his life. Túrin and several of the others connected to his story are some of the few people in the Middle-earth legendarium to have committed suicide.
An alternate interpretation of Túrin's revelation mirrors that of his father's in the Silmarillion, that all that he had seen was twisted by the malice and might of Morgoth, and so as if blind, he stumbled through life.
Túrin was buried near Finduilas' grave, in a high mound where he had fallen, and the shards of Gurthang were set beside him.

The mound they were buried beneath survived the War of Wrath and Tol Morwen was the westernmost isle off the coast of Lindon in the Second and Third Ages.[3]

This delayed the march of the Eastern Army under Maedhros from joining the rest of the coalition in time for the main battle.

With the approval of his father,[3] Valacar married Vidumavi, the daughter of Vidugavia in that time.[4]
In the year 1250,[5] his son Vinitharya was born. Valacar was recalled back to Gondor in the year 1260 by his father to take part in the councils of the realm and the command of its armies.[3] Along with Vidumavi and Vinitharya, Valacar was accompanied by a household of noble men and women from Rhovanion.[3] They were mostly welcomed in Gondor and Valacar gave his son the name Eldacar for public use in Gondor.[3] However, the high men of Gondor disapproved of Valacar's marriage to Vidumavi, who had a shorter lifespan than the Dúnedain because the Northmen were Middle Men. Some conservative Gondorians feared that Eldacar's descendants would also have a short life and weaken the Númenórean blood of the kings. Thus, they did not want to accept Eldacar as their lord. When Valacar grew old, rebellion smoldered in the southern provinces.[4]
Valacar ruled Gondor for sixty-six years, and was succeeded by Eldacar when he died in the year 1432.[1] After Valacar's death, the rebellion turned into a civil war known as the Kin-strife.[6] This conflict lasted for fifteen years, until Eldacar secured the throne.[7]",

Third Age[]
Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin.
Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined  Thorin's company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.
Later years[]
Forty-eight years later, in TA 2989, Óin went to Moria with Balin and Ori, along with many other Dwarves, to recover the realm for the Dwarves of Durin's Folk. After Balin became Lord of Moria, according to the Book of Mazarbul, Óin was sent to look for the Upper Armories of the Third Deep, which were apparently westwards, near the Hollin Gate (the west gate out of Moria). Some five years passed, with Óin at some point re-joining Balin, before the Moria Orcs attacked. The Dwarves could not escape by the eastern gate because the Orcs held the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, so they tried to escape by the Hollin Gate. However, the water outside the door was right up to the wall, and the Watcher in the Water ""took Óin"".[3]

It is known that Gríma, son of Gálmód, was secretly ensnared by Sauron's vassal, Saruman, and became his agent. Wormtongue informed the corrupted Wizard of every notable development throughout the realm and also weakened the ailing King, poisoning his mind and body with his deceitful counsels and false remedies for old age. It is likely that Saruman had promised him Éowyn, the king's niece, as a reward for his services; Wormtongue is accused of ""watching her under his lids and haunting her steps."" It is also possible that he had Dunlending ancestry, since he was darker-haired and physically smaller than the other Rohirrim.
Wormtongue as he began to influence Théoden, by Donato Giancola
The main threats to Gríma's authority were Théoden's son, Théodred, and nephew, Éomer. Failing to estrange the two, Wormtongue tried to portray them as rivals in the King's addled mind, as well as to paint Éomer as an ambitious warmonger.
According to one account, on September 20 in 3018, Gríma was on his way to Isengard to tell Saruman of Gandalf's arrival at Edoras. However, he was captured in the fields of Rohan by the Nazgûl, who were hunting for Gandalf. Gríma was interrogated and divulged what he knew of Saruman's plans to the Nazgûl, specifically his interest in the Shire and its location; this confirmed the corrupted Wizard's disloyalty to the Dark Lord. Previously, the location of the Shire had been unknown to the Nazgûl, but they knew it to be the home of ""Baggins,"" whom they thought still had the One Ring. Wormtongue was set free, for the Witch-king saw that he would not dare tell anyone of their meeting and he guessed that he would be of much use to Sauron (being a capable opportunist), while doing harm to the traitor Saruman in the future. The Ringwraiths set out immediately for the Shire. Had the Nazgûl not captured Gríma, they would instead have pursued Gandalf into Rohan, and possibly not have found the Shire until much later, giving the Hobbits and then the Fellowship of the Ring a considerable head start.[1]
Gríma and King Théoden, under Saruman's spell, as Gandalf enters Meduseld
After Gandalf ended Gríma's control of Théoden and released the King, ""many things which men had missed"" were found locked in his trunk, including Herugrim, the blade of Théoden. With his betrayal revealed, Théoden presented Gríma with a choice: either ride into battle for the King or be exiled. Choosing the latter, he went to dwell with Saruman at Orthanc. Arriving there after the Ent attack, Gríma was captured and imprisoned by the Ents in Orthanc with Saruman. Later, Saruman had cause to regret Gríma's dwelling in Orthanc when, following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, he foolishly threw a ""heavy rock""— which was actually the palantír of Orthanc at either Gandalf or Saruman (it is stated that ""he couldn't decide which he hated most""), an act for which Saruman seems to have punished him severely. Peregrin Took picked up the palantír, which would play a role in defeating Saruman's master, Sauron. Saruman was also said to have scalped Wormtongue and beaten him over time.[2]
After Treebeard granted them release, Gríma accompanied Saruman to the Shire, where the latter sought revenge in petty tyranny over the hobbits; the corrupted Wizard had already been exerting some control from afar through wicked Men in the Shire. During this time, Gríma became increasingly degraded until he was a crawling wretch, a beggar, almost resembling Gollum, and Saruman shortened his nickname to ""Worm"". Eventually, Gríma killed Lotho Sackville-Baggins and may have eaten him, which he claimed to have done under Saruman's orders.
After overthrowing the Ruffians, Wormtongue was initially ready to follow his master out of the Shire. Frodo Baggins attempted to convince him that he no longer needed to follow Saruman, and that he was not evil in his heart. Saruman then mockingly exposed Gríma for murdering Lotho. Angry, he argued that Saruman made him do it, but Saruman responded by mocking and kicking him. This proved to be the last straw for Grima, who finally had enough of his master's physical and verbal abuse he had endured for years. Gríma then used a hidden knife to slit Saruman's throat from behind, killing him. Bewildered by this act and overcome with great shame and anxiety, he cowardly tried to escape but was quickly killed by several arrows fired from the Hobbits present, ending his life.[3]",

Déagol and Sméagol fishing, in the films
Originally a hobbit of the Stoor-country, born in TA 2430, Sméagol spent the early years of his life living with his extended family under a Matriarch, his grandmother. Around the year 2463, Sméagol became the fourth Bearer of the One Ring, after Sauron, Isildur, and Déagol. Déagol was his cousin, and on Sméagol's birthday, they went fishing in the Gladden Fields. It was there that Déagol found a gold Ring in the water, after being pulled out of their boat by a large fish. Almost immediately, Sméagol fell to the power of the Ring, demanding it as a birthday present. When Déagol refused, Sméagol promptly flew into a rage and fought with Déagol over the Ring, choking him to death and taking the Ring as his own. Sméagol was quickly corrupted further by the Ring and banished by his people; turned by his grandmother out of her hole, he was forced to find a home in a cave in the Misty Mountains in around TA 2470. The Ring's malignant influence twisted his Hobbit body, as well as his mind, and prolonged his life far beyond its natural limits. He called it his ""Precious"" or his ""birthday-present"", the latter as a replacement in his mind for killing Déagol.[1]
Life under the Misty Mountains
Gollum seeing light for the first time after his transformation, by Frédéric Bennett
He lived in the Misty Mountains for over four hundred years, living on raw blind fish (which he caught from his small boat), bats, and occasionally, stray Orcs. Gollum even made a song about raw fish, which is ""The rocks and stones! They're like old bones all bare of meat!"" that he used as a riddle to Bilbo, and would much later sing to Frodo Baggins in a longer version. He found Hobbit and Elven food repulsive.
During his centuries under the Ring's influence, he developed a sort of dissociative identity disorder: Sméagol, his ""good"" personality, still vaguely remembered things like friendship and love, while Gollum, his ""bad"" and prevailing personality, was a slave to the Ring and would kill anyone who tried to take it. Years later, Samwise Gamgee would name the good personality ""Slinker"" (for his fawning, eager-to-please demeanor), and the bad personality ""Stinker"". The two personalities often quarreled when he talked to himself (as J.R.R. Tolkien put it, ""through not having anyone else to speak to"") and had a love/hate relationship, mirroring Gollum's love and hatred for the Ring and for himself.
Gollum living in the Misty Mountains
In July, TA 2941, during the Quest of Erebor, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins stumbled upon the dark lake on which he lived and found Gollum's Ring. Gollum had lost the Ring while squabbling with an imp goblin in the network of caves leading to the lake, though in fact it is more proper to say that the Ring abandoned Gollum, for it was known to have a will of its own. As Gandalf says later, it looks after itself, trying to get back to Sauron. After the infamous riddle-game, during which Gollum was unaware of his loss, Gollum refused to show Bilbo the promised way out and plotted to murder him. When he went to get his ""birthday present,"" however, he found that it was gone. He suddenly realized the true answer to Bilbo's last riddle—""What have I got in my pocket?"" -, breaking into a rage and then begun to chase him in the tunnels. Bilbo inadvertently stumbled across the Ring's power of invisibility as he ran, allowing him to follow Gollum to the back entrance of the cave. There, Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum, but was overcome with pity, so he jumped over him to escape. As Bilbo ran, Gollum cried out, ""Thief! Thief, Baggins! Curse it and crush it! We hates it forever!""; he did not immediately follow Bilbo out of fear of being caught by the goblins, and so lingered in his cave.[2]
Gollum with Bilbo, as imagined by Darrell Sweet
Search for the Ring
Gollum eventually left the Mountains and pursued Bilbo a few years later, but the trail was cold. He made his way south to Mordor where all evil was being drawn at the time, discovering the secret Stairs of Cirith Ungol located near Minas Morgul and surviving an encounter with Shelob. He was captured on his return, taken to the dungeons of Barad-dûr and forced to reveal to Sauron under intense torture what he knew about the Ring. Gollum was then freed, as Sauron had learned all he needed from him and sensed he might draw out the Ring. He was then subsequently caught by Aragorn, then interrogated by Gandalf, who placed him in the care of the Silvan Elves living in Thranduil's kingdom in Mirkwood. Assisted by Orcs, he escaped them, and set off looking for the Shire. He passed through Moria, but could not make it out of the Doors of Durin. Seemingly, he then just waited there until he got lucky when the Fellowship of the Ring passed through. However, as Frodo was a ring-bearer, he might have foreseen the passing of the Ring. Alternatively, some of Saruman's or Sauron's spies may have revealed to him the Fellowship was heading towards Moria.[3]
Gollum on the hunt for Bilbo, by Eric Velhagen
The War of the Ring
Gollum met and started following the Fellowship of the Ring in Moria and was spotted and heard by Frodo on several occasions. On January 15, 3019, the Fellowship was divided when Gandalf disappeared while fighting a Balrog (though he later returned). Gollum continued trailing the remaining members. It is unknown how he crossed the broken Bridge of Khazad-dûm, but he came with them to Lórien without their knowing. Gollum followed their boats down Anduin (floating on a log) to Nen Hithoel and pursued Frodo and Sam across the Emyn Muil when they struck out on their own towards Mordor. Gollum followed them, but after a confrontation (in which he bit and nearly strangled Sam for the Ring), Frodo subdued him and threatened to kill him with Sting, the Elvish blade that Gollum had apparently recognized by its former owner - Bilbo. Sam tied an elven-rope around Gollum's neck for a leash, which inflicted great pain on Gollum. Taking pity, Frodo made Gollum swear to help them. Agreeing to the oath, Gollum swore by the ""Precious"" itself as the Ring was treacherous and would hold Gollum to his word, so Frodo released him to show them the way to Mordor. The unlikely company, guided by Gollum, made its way to the Black Gate of Mordor.
Gollum's spying eyes in the Mines of Moria
Along the way, it was revealed that Gollum, having lived in a cave for hundreds of years, feared both the Sun and the Moon, calling them the 'Yellow Face' and the 'White Face' respectively.
Frodo's kindness brought out the ""Sméagol"" personality, and he made at least some effort to keep his promise. The two had a strange sort of bond from both having been Ring-bearers; in Gollum, Frodo saw his possible future, and so wanted to save him so he could save himself. Apart from Gandalf and Bilbo, Frodo was the only person known to have shown kindness towards Gollum, who was hated instantly by everyone he met, being perceived as filthy, slimy, sneaky and suspect by groups as different as the Orcs of Cirith Ungol and the Rangers of Ithilien.
When the Black Gate was reached and found to be well guarded, Gollum convinced them not to go that way, saying that they would be caught and Sauron would regain the Ring. Gollum said he would lead them south, where he knew of another entrance into Mordor, in which Frodo complied, despite Sam's suspicions.
Frodo and Sam were caught by Faramir, and Gollum followed them. When Frodo allowed Faramir to briefly take Gollum prisoner, however, he felt betrayed, allowing the ""Gollum"" personality to take total control. Faramir found out that the place Gollum was taking them was called Cirith Ungol. He then warned Frodo and Sam of the evil of that place.
Gollum leading Sam and Frodo up the dangerous stairs along the Morgul Vale, by Stephen Hickman
Frodo, Sam, and Gollum left Faramir and began crossing the Morgul Vale and proceeded to climb the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, in the border-mountains of the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow). Gollum visited the great spider Shelob, child of Ungoliant, because he was planning to betray the hobbits by turning them to Shelob for food and then take the Ring for himself. The fact that Gollum managed to forge an alliance with Shelob is also remarkable, as she was otherwise known for devouring and killing everything on sight. When he returned, the hobbits were asleep. The sight of Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent, as he began to pet Frodo's hair. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to Gollum and all hope of redemption was lost. Gollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into Torech Ungol.
Just as Faramir warned them, Gollum did betray them, as after leading them into Shelob's lair, Gollum disappeared and waited for Shelob to kill them so he could claim the Ring for himself. When Shelob started chasing after Frodo, Gollum used this opportunity to attack Sam. However, he was no match for Sam, who gained the upper-hand, forcing Gollum to retreat.
Frodo and Sam escaped from her lair and also Cirith Ungol. They came against all odds to the fiery volcano Mount Doom. Gollum followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, he attacked, but failed to get the Ring. Sam, who had hated Gollum on sight, tried to bring himself to kill him, but he relented out of sheer pity and disgust, turning his back on the beaten (but still wily) creature.
Death
Moments later, Frodo was standing on the edge of the Cracks of Doom, but, unable to destroy the Ring, claimed it for himself and put it on. Then, Gollum attacked the hobbits again. He knocked out Sam with a rock whilst Frodo was invisible, and then, tracking his footprints, jumped on Frodo's shoulders.  The two fought and Gollum ultimately bit off Frodo's finger with the ring on it.
Here, Bilbo's long-ago kindness in sparing Gollum's life was rewarded, as Gollum then teetered on the edge of the great pit, overjoyed with finally reclaiming his ""precious"" until losing his balance and falling into the molten lava below while still holding the Ring, causing his own death and, indirectly, the Ring's utter destruction. Had Bilbo taken Gollum's life early on, the chance of Sauron's regaining the Ring would have greatly increased as he knew where Frodo was as soon as he put it on.
Legacy
Frodo did forgive Gollum, as Gandalf had pointed out to him that Gollum was not an evil entity deserving death, but a pitiful being unnaturally and irreversibly bound to the Ring's will, and that Frodo would have almost certainly suffered a similar fate had he kept the Ring.

Radagast as a Maia named Aiwendil before leaving the Undying Lands, by Moi-Keiniku-Sang
Originally named Aiwendil (Quenya: ""Friend to birds""), Radagast was a Maia created before Time who descended into Arda to serve the Valar.[1] Aiwendil served the Valië Yavanna, Queen of the earth.
When the Undying Lands were separated from Arda after the Downfall of Númenor, Manwë was still concerned for the fate of the peoples of Middle-earth. Though Sauron had been overthrown, he had not been permanently vanquished. In time, his shadow began to emerge again. A council of the Valar was summoned, and it was decided that they would send emissaries to Middle-earth. These messengers should be ""mighty peers of Sauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh,"" as they were intended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron. These emissaries themselves, the wizards, did not match the Dark Lord in power. Aulë chose Curumo (Saruman), Oromë chose Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards), and Manwë chose Olórin (Gandalf). Yavanna subsequently begged Curumo to take Aiwendil with him.

Third Age[]
Arrival in Middle-earth[]
Around the year TA 1000, the Maia arrived at the Grey Havens in the west of Eriador, having the form of old Men, whom the peoples called Wizards. Curumo arrived first and alone, and Aiwendil arrived at the same time as Olórin.[2] When the Wizards took their mission, they roamed Middle-earth. In this period, Aiwendil was renamed ""Radagast"" by the Ñoldor and became known for both his protection of the great Forests and his zeal for the animals, worrying little with the affairs of Men and Elves, but was far more knowledgeable in plants, birds and beasts in the forest. He also turned away from Saruman during this period, unaware that the White Wizard despised him and considered him a fool.
Radagast in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.
In general, Radagast was never much of a traveler.[3] There is little told of his early journeys, but by the late Third Age, he had settled down and dwelt for a time at Rhosgobel, somewhere between the Carrock and the Menn-i-Naugrim.[2] Situated on the western edge of Mirkwood, the Wizard likely held watch against the shadow of Dol Guldur that slowly engulfed much of the forest. He likely became acquainted with that region's inhabitants. Close to animals and birds, he was friends with the Great Eagles.[3] Although the neighboring Beorn was unsociable, he saw Radagast from time to time and considered him ""not bad"" for a Wizard.[4]
War of the Ring[]
In TA 2851, the White Council met once more, after which Saruman began to search the Gladden Fields for the One Ring. Radagast decided to aid his search, with birds and beasts acting as spies, hoping that Saruman's actions would help keep watch and hinder Sauron. Radagast did this in good faith, knowing nothing of Saruman's true ambition to acquire and keep the Ring for himself.[5]
By the War of the Ring, Radagast no longer dwelt in Rhosgobel. In summer of TA 3018, Saruman told Radagast that he was willing to help Gandalf and sent the Brown Wizard to seek Gandalf at once. Radagast knew little of Eriador but sought for the Shire, knowing that he would find Gandalf nearby.[3]
Indeed, on Midsummer's Day, Radagast was sitting on the side of the Greenway with his horse near Bree when Gandalf found him on his way to the village. Radagast warned Gandalf that the Nazgûl were abroad, disguised as riders in black, seeking news of the Shire. He also gave Gandalf Saruman's invitation and agreed to help Gandalf by having beasts and birds to send news to Orthanc. With that he rode away back towards Mirkwood.[3]
Radagast the Brown during the War of the Ring
Saruman's message proved to be a trap for Gandalf who, after coming to Orthanc, was imprisoned; but Gandalf still believed that Radagast was not under Saruman's sway. Indeed, it was thanks to Radagast that Gandalf was able to escape from the pinnacle of Orthanc upon the wings of Gwaihir.[3]
Radagast's actions during and after the rest of the War are not recorded. After the Council of Elrond, scouts were sent out from Rivendell to many different locations. Some passed over the Misty Mountains and eventually came to Rhosgobel, but found that Radagast was not there.[6] His fate after the War of the Ring is untold,[2] however, as his task had been to oppose Sauron, his powers likely would have dwindled if he remained in Middle-earth after Mordor's destruction.

Gandalf as a Maia named Olórin before leaving the Undying Lands - by Annie Claudine
Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur,[1] and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.[2] In his ""youth"" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda,[3] yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him out of despair.[3]
When the Valar decided to send the Istari (also called Wizards) to Middle-earth to counsel and assist all those who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, Manwë and Varda included Olórin among the five to be sent. At first, Olórin was nervous and described himself as too weak and afraid of Sauron. Manwë understood, and told Olórin that such was a reason why he should go, to overcome that fear. Furthermore, the One Ring, containing much of Sauron's power, presumably still existed somewhere. Thus, Manwë insisted that Olórin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him to send Olórin as the second instead.[4] He agreed, and prepared for Olórin's departure from the Undying Lands with the other four, arriving about the same time that the Necromancer appeared in Mirkwood.
Third Age
Arrival in Middle-earth
Olórin, like the other Wizards, took the shape of an old man. He was robed in grey and wandered about as a counsellor. At Mithlond he was welcomed by Glorfindel, his friend from Valinor (who had been sent earlier on a similar mission), and Círdan the shipwright who possessed Narya, one of the Three Elven Rings of Power. Círdan divined in Olórin a sense of strength and power despite his appearance as a bent and aged man. Círdan gave Narya to Olórin with a prediction of his future struggles with evil, and a promise that it would support and aid him in his labours.[5]
Gandalf the Grey wandering Middle-earth, by Robert Zigo
Gandalf, by Jay Johnstone
He then began his sojourn in Middle-earth and over many centuries, he walked among the Elves as a stranger, learning from them and teaching them. Unlike Saruman, Olórin never took up permanent residence, and never went to the east, apparently restricting his activities to the Westlands of Middle-earth, where the remnants of the Dúnedain and the Eldar remained to oppose Sauron. He was known by many names during the long years he wandered: Elves named him Mithrandir, the ""Grey Pilgrim"", while the Men of Arnor coined Gandalf, which became his most common name. He was also known as Incánus in the South and as Tharkûn to the Dwarves.[4] He later revealed himself as one of the Istari, and eventually became known as not only the wisest but also the most powerful of them.
A legend tells that Gandalf had been given by Yavanna the Elfstone of Eärendil, to bring to the peoples of Middle-earth as a token that the Valar had not forsook them. He gave this to Galadriel, bearer of one of the three Elven Rings and mighty among the Eldar, who prophesied that she would in turn pass it to one who would also be called Elessar.[6]
Reemergence of the Necromancer
Around year TA 1100, the Istari and Eldar discovered that some evil entity resided in at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood; while some thought a Nazgûl had returned to torment the world, or some new evil was arising, Gandalf began to suspect that perhaps Sauron himself might have returned.[5][7] As in the next two hundred years, evil continued to grow and spread, as well as the source directing it. Gandalf went to Dol Guldur in TA 2063 to discover its secret.[5] However, the Necromancer fled upon Gandalf's arrival, preventing Gandalf from identifying him.[7] After Gandalf's incursion, the evil there seemed to desist, and its absence allowed for some centuries of calmness.[7]
Ian McKellen as Gandalf in the late Third age
That peaceful period was known as the Watchful Peace and lasted for almost four hundred years, but the Nazgûl had used this period to prepare for Sauron's return, in TA 2460.[5] Realising the returning evil, Galadriel formed and reunited the White Council three years later composed of four members: herself, Gandalf, Saruman, and Elrond the Half-elf (who was the bearer of another of the Three Rings). Galadriel wished Gandalf to be the chief of the Council, but he refused the position, wishing to set down no roots and to maintain his independence; Saruman took this place instead because of his vast knowledge and skill.[7] However, he later grew jealous and afraid of Gandalf,[5] which was one of the reasons for his future betrayal.
During his wanderings in Eriador, Gandalf met and befriended the isolated and secretive people of the Hobbits in their country, the Shire. During the Long Winter of TA 2758 Gandalf came to their aid.[5] It was then when he witnessed and admired the pity and courage that the humble Hobbits reserved in their hearts.[8] 
He then passed onward but nevertheless would return to visit the Shire occasionally and participate in the Midsummer-eve parties of the Old Took, where he impressed young Hobbits with his fireworks, and his stories about Dragons, Goblins and princesses.[8] He was thus known to be ""responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures"". He also met a relatively adventurous Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, although he was in fact far from ""adventuresome.""[9]
Gandalf finds Thráin in the dungeons of Dol Guldur
When King Thráin II, a Dwarf of the royal line of Durin, disappeared on journey to Erebor, Gandalf looked for him. At some point after TA 2845 he entered the abandoned city of Khazad-dûm during this search. After this proved to be in vain, the Wizard exited through the Doors of Durin; however this experience did not help him know how to open the doors from the outside.[10] In TA 2850, his quest led him once more to Dol Guldur, this time in secrecy.[5] He found Thráin in the dungeons, who gave the Wizard his last possessions, the map and key to Erebor.[11] Most importantly, he found out that the Necromancer was not a Nazgûl – it was Sauron himself, and he had taken the last of the Seven Rings from the Dwarf King; Sauron was gathering the remaining Rings of Power and possibly searching for his lost One Ring.
The White Council meeting on the question of Dol Guldur
Gandalf escaped Dol Guldur and returned to the White Council.[7] After relating his discoveries, he urged the council to attack Sauron while the One Ring was still lost and while Sauron's power was not yet beginning to be restored . But Saruman said that it was better to watch and wait; that the One Ring had long ago rolled from Anduin to the Sea. The majority of the council agreed with Saruman. Elrond later privately told Gandalf he had a foreboding that the Ring would be found, and that the war to end the Age was coming. Indeed, Elrond added, he feared that it would end in darkness and despair. Gandalf encouraged him, saying there were many ""strange chances,"" and that, ""help oft shall come from the hands of the weak"". Gandalf did not yet realize that Saruman now wanted the Ring for himself and was secretly searching for it along the banks of the River Anduin.
As time went on, the wizard became increasingly troubled by his knowledge of Sauron's resurgent strength. He knew that Sauron was already plotting war from Dol Guldur, and that as soon as he felt strong enough, he would attack Rivendell. Unfortunately, the only power left besides Rivendell to resist an attempt from Mirkwood to regain the lands of Angmar were the isolated Dwarves of the Iron Hills.
Quest of Erebor
Main article: Quest of Erebor
Conception of a plan
Over the years, Gandalf became concerned about the weak state of the North. Smaug the dragon had destroyed both the Kingdom under the Mountain and the town of Dale, and the wizard feared that Sauron might use the desolation around Erebor to regain the northern passes in the mountains and reclaim the old lands of Angmar. Worse still, Gandalf knew that it was only a matter of time before the Dark Lord  regained enough power to exert influence over Smaug. With the dragon at his command, Sauron's victory would be all but assured.
Gandalf knew that exiled Dwarf King of Durin's Folk, Thorin II, planned to battle against Smaug, but he knew that it would not be enough. In TA 2941,[5] while staying the night in Bree, Gandalf happened across the Dwarf King.[8] Thorin initiated conversation; he had been having a strange feeling urging him to seek Gandalf. The same was intrigued, for he had thought to seek Thorin as well. They found they were taking the same road for a while (Thorin passing through the Shire on his way to the Ered Luin), and they agreed to travel together. Thorin wanted advice, and Gandalf in turn wanted to discuss the dragon Smaug with Thorin.
Ultimately, Gandalf concocted a plan wherein Thorin could destroy Smaug and recover his family fortune, albeit with a ""burglar"" of Gandalf's own choosing.
Leading the company
Gandalf invites Bilbo Baggins on an adventure
Feeling that a Hobbit should be involved, Gandalf remembered Bilbo Baggins. At first he found only Holman Cotton as Bilbo had left on the occasion of the Elven new year, something that persuaded Gandalf that Bilbo was the right person for the job.[8] He visited Bilbo later, bringing along the kinsmen of Thorin.[9] In the end, Gandalf convinced the reluctant Baggins to become a burglar for Thorin. Gandalf then accompanied Thorin and Company to Rivendell. During the journey Gandalf was instrumental in saving the travellers' lives from several calamities. He saved them from a trio of Stone-trolls, and later obtained the legendary sword Glamdring from their Troll-hoard; Gandalf bore it thenceforth.[12]
He also helped Thorin and Company through the Misty Mountains; when unknowingly they camped in the Front Porch of Goblin-town, the Northern Orcs captured the whole company except Gandalf, who surprised them much later, killing the Great Goblin and then leading the Dwarves to the Goblin-gate.[13] It was during this time that Bilbo obtained a ""magic ring"".[14] Bilbo initially claimed he ""won"" it from the creature ""Gollum"" while the company was under the Misty Mountains.[15] The Ring conferred invisibility on Bilbo when he wore it, and he kept it secret from Gandalf for some time.
On their escape out, the Company was saved by the Eagles of the Misty Mountains; Gandalf once had healed the Lord of the Eagles from an arrow-wound, and thenceforth they became friends. The Eagles picked them up from the Great Shelf, and the next day they dropped them off on the Carrock.[15]
Pressing business
Gandalf, by Donato Giancola
Gandalf then sought the hospitality of Beorn, persuading him to welcome and host the whole Company in his hall. But then he left the quest prior to its completion; after leading the Company to the outskirts of the Forest Gate, he gave them some final advice before they entered Mirkwood, and went to attend other obligations.[16][17] The White Council had met under the gravest of circumstances: Sauron's power was returning, even without his Ring. Gandalf at last convinced the Council to attack Dol Guldur, to which even Saruman agreed (as by now he feared Sauron as a rival, and wished to delay his search for the Ring). Gandalf joined his peers in assailing Dol Guldur, ridding Mirkwood of the Necromancer's presence, who fled to Mordor to his long-prepared stronghold of Barad-dûr.[18] When he was about to finish his task, news about what happened to Thorin's Company in Mirkwood reached him, and realized that the instructions he gave did not help them; they had lost their way, and then vanished due to the encounter with the Wood-elves, who had captured them. He was anxious to get back to them as soon as possible.[19]
The Battle of Five Armies
Meanwhile Thorin's quest was successful: Erebor was retaken and Smaug was killed,[20] but when Gandalf finally arrived to the area, he found the Dwarves of Erebor and the Iron Hills preparing for an attack by the Lake-men and the Elves of Mirkwood. He was with Bard and Thranduil and thus revealed his presence, trying to reason with Thorin. When the attack was beginning, Gandalf halted them, to warn that the Orcs and Wargs were coming to claim the treasure. He invited Dáin Ironfoot for council, and soon Dwarves, Elves and Men formed an alliance, and defeated the Orcs of the Misty Mountains in the Battle of Five Armies.[21]
King Thorin was mortally wounded and, after his funeral and the reestablishment of Erebor under Dáin, Bilbo and Gandalf followed their way back; they celebrated Yule at Beorn's, and then returned to Rivendell, where he discussed with Elrond the events of Dol Guldur and the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf had accomplished his immediate goal, which was to destroy Smaug, since he could have been used to disastrous effect by Sauron. A large number of Orcs and Wargs also were killed in the North, removing threats to Rivendell and Lothlórien.[8] The two agreed that it would be better if the Necromancer were banished from the world altogether.[22]
As Gandalf and Bilbo passed by the site of their former encounter with the stone-trolls, they made sure to recover the gold of the troll-hoard they had buried before the Wizard left to perform other duties and Bilbo returned to the Shire.[22] Gandalf, for his part, found himself amazed by the Hobbit; until then, the Wise had paid no attention to Hobbits and knew little of them. For the rest of his sojourn in Middle-earth, Gandalf took a special interest in Hobbits, and particularly in the Baggins family.

Despite the Council's hopes, Sauron was not weakened by this attack. He had foreseen the move that drove him from Mirkwood, and his retreat was but a feint. Ten years after the attack, Sauron declared himself openly in Mordor in 2951 and rebuilt his fortress of Barad-dûr. The White Council met for one last time in 2953 to debate the fate of the Rings of Power. Saruman quieted his peers claiming to have the knowledge that the One Ring was lost in the Belegaer. After their meeting, Saruman, jealous and afraid of Gandalf, set spies to watch all his movements; this would affect the peaceful Hobbits, as Saruman thus discovered the existence and noted Gandalf's interest in the Shire, and started sending agents to Bree and the Southfarthing.[5]
In 2956, Gandalf met Aragorn, the hidden Heir of Isildur, and soon became friends with him. From that point on Aragorn and Gandalf often worked together towards a common end - the defeat of Sauron.
Return to the Shire
During this period Gandalf visited the Shire frequently, especially his friend Bilbo Baggins, and his younger nephew, Frodo. He noted Bilbo's unusual youthfulness, despite his advancing age; the suspicious ""magic ring"" that Bilbo had acquired during his adventure began to weigh on his mind. Gandalf recalled the deceit Bilbo used in originally claiming it for his own—Bilbo had later admitted to stealing it from Gollum. Gandalf could see that Bilbo was now very preoccupied with the Ring and had begun to suspect that the same was indeed a ring of power. Such un-hobbitlike behaviour aroused his suspicions.
Gandalf entering Hobbiton, by Darrell Sweet
In 3001, Bilbo planned what would become known as his Farewell Birthday Party, and at the culmination of the hobbit's speech, Bilbo put on the mysterious Ring and disappeared, as a joke on his neighbors. Later as he was bidding farewell to Gandalf, who had known about his plans to leave, Bilbo began to change his mind about leaving his Ring to Frodo, as he had earlier agreed. When Gandalf tried to persuade him to leave it, Bilbo became hostile and accused Gandalf of trying to steal the Ring for his own benefit, which he referred to as his ""precious."" Horrified by Bilbo's outburst, Gandalf stood to his full height and projected his power, frightening the hobbit. This brought Bilbo back to his senses; he apologized, admitting that the Ring had been troubling him lately, and begrudgingly left it behind. Bilbo and Gandalf bid each other goodbye before Bilbo left the Shire for his journey.[23] Before leaving the Shire, he spoke with Frodo, emphatically warning him not to use the Ring.[24]

Searching for the Ring
Keen now to find out more about Gollum, he sought Aragorn's help to capture him. Studying the records in Minas Tirith, he found the Scroll of Isildur and pieced together the missing history of the One Ring. In TA 3017 on his way back to the Shire he got word from the Galadhrim that Aragorn had finally captured Gollum and he went to Mirkwood to meet him. For days he interrogated him in order to verify what he already suspected. A great fear came over him when he learned that Gollum had been to the Tower of Barad-dûr. Sauron had tortured Gollum and learned not only of the ""magic ring"", but also the names ""Shire"" and ""Baggins"". Gandalf left Mirkwood soon after, and left Gollum with the Wood-elves of Northern Mirkwood.[5] He now returned in haste to the Shire, certain that Frodo's ring was not simply a ring of power: it was the One Ruling Ring of Sauron.
War of the Ring
Main article: War of the Ring
Upon returning to the Shire, Gandalf immediately went to Frodo and confirmed his suspicions by throwing the Ring into Frodo's hearth fire, which revealed, in Black Speech, the inscription upon the Ring. Gandalf then told a dumbfounded Frodo about the One Ring and its history, and how Sauron would seek to regain it. Instructing Frodo to go to Rivendell with the Ring, Gandalf told him to make arrangements to leave the Shire quietly.
Gandalf telling Frodo of the Ring, by Donato Giancola
While in the Shire, he had a sense of foreboding; in the aftermath of Sauron's assault on Osgiliath, Gandalf heard disturbing news about war in Gondor and a Black Shadow. He started wandering around Eriador, hearing news from the refugees who had a fear they could not speak about, until he met Radagast the Brown who brought a message from Saruman that he must seek him at once; and a warning that the Ringwraiths were looking for the Shire.[25] He went to The Prancing Pony at Bree. Believing that he would not be able to return to Frodo in time, he wrote a letter, urging him to move as soon as possible for Rivendell, and seek a ""Strider"" whose real name was Aragorn, along with a riddle to identify him; Gandalf would then try to catch up with them when available. He also instructed Barliman Butterbur to send the letter to Hobbiton and to expect a Mr. Baggins that would come under the name of ""Mr. Underhill"". He left the inn, but Barliman would forget to send the letter.[26]
Saruman's betrayal
I keep a clearer memory of your arguments, and deeds, than you suppose. When last I visited you, you were the jailor of Mordor, and there I was to be sent.—Gandalf to Saruman, The Lord of the Rings, Vol. II: The Two Towers, Book Three, Ch. X: ""The Voice of Saruman""
Gwaihir bearing Gandalf away from Orthanc, by Stephen Hickman
Soon thereafter Gandalf arrived at Isengard to consult with Saruman. At their meeting, Saruman finally revealed himself as ""an ally, or servant of Sauron"" and offered his ""old friend and helper"" two choices: to rule Middle-earth together with the Dark Lord or wield the Ring's power for themselves. Gandalf refused ""to submit to Sauron, or to [Saruman]"", and was imprisoned on the pinnacle of Orthanc. Gandalf was aware that Saruman would try to coerce the Ring's whereabouts out of him and then hand him over to Sauron in Mordor. But the Grey Pilgrim was saved from such a fate: Gwaihir the Windlord, soon arrived and helped Gandalf escape. Gwaihir's real purpose for visiting Orthanc was to report a sighting of the Nazgûl, as Radagast had appealed to him to do so earlier on. Gandalf knew he must return quickly to the Shire, as Frodo (and the Ring) were in grave danger from both Sauron's chief agents: the Nazgûl and now Saruman, who actually wanted the Ring for himself.
Journey to Rivendell
Gandalf hurriedly went to Rohan, desiring to find a strong steed; there he obtained Shadowfax from King Théoden, who later resented the gift. This mighty horse and Gandalf forged a special bond, and Gandalf made quick use of Shadowfax's incredible strength and endurance.
Gandalf sped to the Shire. Fortunately, Frodo had already left the Shire without waiting for Gandalf, and was seeking the refuge of Rivendell. Upon arrival, Gandalf learned that the Nazgûl, arrayed as Black Riders, had been searching the area. Dismayed, he set out for Bree; Barliman apologised to Gandalf for forgetting to send the letter, worried that the hobbits had left with Strider, the suspicious Ranger. But for Gandalf, this was a hope which far exceeded his expectations. After congratulating a puzzled Barliman, and blessing his beer, Gandalf then made for Weathertop, a high point in the region, to observe the surrounding area.
Gandalf fighting the Nazgûl, as illustrated by Ted Nasmith
There he was assaulted at night by the Nazgûl, but drove them off after a great battle of light and flame. These phenomena were seen by Aragorn and the hobbits from afar, without knowing it was Gandalf. Before leaving, he marked some stones with the cirth G for them to find, then fled east, drawing four of the Ringwraiths after him.
Several days later, Frodo, Aragorn, and company stayed at Weathertop and were confronted by the remaining five Nazgûl. Despite their escape, Frodo was stabbed in the process by the Lord of the Nazgûl with a Morgul-knife.[27] Gandalf was able to evade the four Nazgûl and successfully reach Rivendell and was welcomed by Glorfindel. However, several days later, an injured Frodo arrived at the Ford of Bruinen, though the Nazgûl pursued him all the way there. Gandalf, along with Elrond, saved Frodo from the Nazgûl by enchanting the water and sweeping them away.[28]
Forming of the Fellowship
Elrond called a council after Frodo was healed to consider the momentous decision regarding the Ring. There Gandalf explained to the others how he had been imprisoned in Isengard and how Saruman was building his own army of Orcs to eventually betray Sauron, his new master.[25] By chance, representatives of most of the free peoples happened to be in Rivendell already for various reasons. Elrond and Gandalf advised that the Ring should be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was made. Others dissented or objected, but eventually submitted to Gandalf's plan. Ultimately, Elrond appointed the Fellowship of the Ring as nine walkers, numerically set against Sauron's nine Nazgûl. The relatively small number reflected the realisation by Elrond and the other council members that the Quest of Mount Doom would not rely upon strength of arms, but on stealth and good fortune. Gandalf was chosen to lead the company, which included Aragorn, Boromir of Gondor, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and the hobbits Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin Took, and Meriadoc Brandybuck.
Gandalf leading the Fellowship through Eregion
Several obstacles stood in the company's way. Gandalf was determined not to lead the company near Isengard, so the vast Misty Mountains had to be crossed. Gandalf decided to take a southern route to the Redhorn Pass and cross the mountains that way, traversing the mountain range and avoiding Isengard. When this attempt failed due to a terrible storm, he then decided to take the Fellowship through the ruins of Moria, where the remains of the great Dwarf city of Khazad-dûm was now a labyrinth of abandoned tunnels under the mountains. Others in the company were loathe to enter the maze, as it was now the lair of Orcs and something known only as ""Durin's Bane"".
Gandalf the Grey, by Giovani Bellofatto
Fall in Moria
At the Doors of Durin on the west side of the mountains, Gandalf, after some delay, spoke the password and led the company into the dark. Having been in Moria on an earlier perilous errand, he was somewhat familiar with the underground passages. Eventually the party came to the Chamber of Mazarbul, where Gandalf read the Book of Records, which revealed the fate of Balin, the leader of an ill-fated attempt to re-colonise Moria. Soon after, the party was attacked by Orcs, and forced to flee the chamber. By then Gandalf was well aware of their location, and he led the party quickly towards the eastern exit.
You cannot pass,"" he said. The Orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. ""I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.—The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I: The Fellowship of the Ring, Book II, Ch. 5: ""The Bridge of Khazad-dûm""
Gandalf and the Balrog
Unfortunately Durin's Bane caught up to the group at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. Gandalf and Legolas immediately realised what it was: a Balrog of Morgoth, a servant of the first Dark Lord. In a spectacular display of bravery, Gandalf faced the demon and broke the bridge both stood upon, leaving the beast to fall into a seemingly bottomless chasm. But the Balrog's whip lashed out, and grasped Gandalf by the knees, causing him to fall into the pit. While falling, Gandalf shouted ""Fly, you fools"" and vanished into the abyss.[29]
Gandalf dueling on Zirakzigil, by Raoul Vitale
Yet Gandalf did not die; he and the Balrog fell for a long time, and the wizard was burned by the Balrog's fire. Then they plunged into a deep lake in the depths of the mountain, which Gandalf later said was cold as the tide of death and almost froze his heart. They fought in the water until finally the Balrog fled into dark tunnels, where the world was gnawed by nameless things, older even than Sauron. Gandalf pursued the creature until it led him to the spiralling Endless Stair, and they climbed it until they reached Durin's Tower in the living rock of Zirakzigil, the pinnacle of the Silvertine above the clouds. There they fought, until at last Gandalf threw down his enemy, and the Balrog broke the mountain-side as it fell. Then darkness took Gandalf, and he passed away. His body lay on the peak. The entire battle, from the confrontation on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm to the mutual demise of the Balrog and Gandalf, had taken ten days.
Resurrection
Then darkness took me, and I strayed out of thought and time, and I wandered far on roads that I will not tell... Naked I was sent back – for a brief time, until my task is done. And naked I lay upon the mountain-top. … There I lay staring upward, while the stars wheeled over, and each day was as long as a life-age of the earth.—The Lord of the Rings, Vol. II: The Two Towers, Book Three, Ch. V: ""The White Rider""
Gandalf riding Shadowfax, by Ralph Damiani
But Gandalf's spirit did not depart Middle-earth forever at this time. As the only one of the five Istari to stay true to his errand, Olórin/Gandalf was sent back to mortal lands by Eru, and he became Gandalf once again. Yet, as he was now the sole emissary of the Valar to Middle-earth, he was granted the power to ""reveal"" more of his inner Maiar strength. This naked power that lay within him was seldom used during the remainder of his time in Middle-earth, as his mission was essentially the same: to support and succor those who opposed Sauron. Nevertheless, when Gandalf's wrath was kindled his ""unveiled"" strength was such that few of Sauron's servants could withstand him.
Three days later he was found by the windlord Gwaihir, Lord of the Eagles, who had been sent by Galadriel to find him. Gandalf was carried to Caras Galadhon in Lothlórien, where he was healed, given a new staff, and clothed in white, and thus became Gandalf the White. He soon learned that Frodo and Sam had left the Fellowship and were attempting the quest of Mount Doom without the others, and was greatly gladdened to hear that Sam had accompanied Frodo.
War in Rohan
Gandalf confronting Théoden, controlled by Saruman
As Frodo was beyond his assistance now, Gandalf promptly went south to Fangorn Forest, where he met the Three Hunters, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, and gave them messages from Galadriel. Then he called forth Shadowfax, and rode with them to Edoras. There he found that Saruman's spy Gríma Wormtongue had deceived King Théoden into hopeless impotence. Gandalf quickly deposed Wormtongue and encouraged Théoden to ride west to war against Saruman. Gandalf by now was keenly aware that the great war to end the age was beginning; if Isengard conquered Rohan then Gondor would be crushed between the Enemy's pincers.[30][31]
Keep well the Lord of the Mark, till I return. Await me at Helm's Gate. Farewell!—Gandalf to Aragorn and Éomer and the men of the king's household
Gandalf the White returns, at Helm's Deep
At Gandalf's encouragement, King Théoden went west to the Hornburg where he was quickly besieged; Gandalf then searched for Erkenbrand and the scattered forces of the Westfold, which he later found and led to the Deep, thus breaking the siege. Meanwhile, the Ents (along with, and persuaded by, the Hobbits Merry and Pippin) moved against Saruman and sent Huorns against the Orcs, resulting in the utter ruin of the outer walls of Isengard and the complete annihilation of Saruman's Orcs.
Then I gave [Saruman] a last choice and a fair one: to renounce both Mordor and his private schemes, and make amends by helping us in our need. —Gandalf to Merry, The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, Book Three, Chapter X: ""The Voice of Saruman""
After the battle, Gandalf went to Orthanc with Théoden, Aragorn, and a small group to confront Saruman. There Saruman attempted to sway Gandalf to his side one more time, but Gandalf remained undaunted, recalling Saruman's actions as the ""jailor of Mordor"" during his last visit to Isengard. Reminding Saruman that he had betrayed both ""[his] neighbors"" and ""[his] new master"", Gandalf offered him a chance of redemption, if Saruman came down and surrendered his staff and the keys of Orthanc as a pledge. The Wizard, however, squandered this chance with contempt.  Gandalf then broke Saruman's staff and expelled him from both the Istari's ranks and the White Council. As Saruman crawled back into Orthanc, Gríma, unsure whether he hated Saruman or Gandalf more, threw down the tower's palantír and hit neither; the Seeing Stone was picked up by Pippin and taken by Gandalf. Gandalf imposed a strict watch on Isengard by the Ents and then advised  Théoden to ride to Gondor's defense as soon as possible. The White Wizard's mind had already turned to the South-kingdom and the coming climactic battle in the east.[32]
Siege of Gondor
Gandalf saves the Osgiliath force
As a 'reward' for Pippin, who had foolishly gazed into a palantír, Gandalf took the Hobbit with him to Minas Tirith, the last bastion of the west. Soon after arriving, Gandalf confronted Denethor II, the Ruling Steward, and learned that he was near despair over the death of his eldest son, Boromir. Pippin entered the Steward's service in payment of the debt that he and Merry owed, the death of Boromir. Ostensibly they were allies, but the Steward treated Gandalf with scorn and suspicion. When Faramir, the Steward's younger son, returned from Osgiliath and was attacked by Nazgûl, Gandalf upon Shadowfax drove them away by revealing the power within him; later Faramir told him that Frodo and Sam were still alive and headed towards Mordor.
Minas Tirith was soon besieged by a vast force from Mordor, led by the Witch-king of Angmar. Faramir having received a wound from a poisoned dart in the retreat from Osgiliath, lay near death inside the Tower. Still, Gandalf encouraged the men of Minas Tirith to have hope, and dispelled the fear of the Ringwraiths by his very presence. But Sauron's catapults hurled flaming bolts upon the city; soon the first circle of the city burned unchecked. Denethor now lost all heart as the city burned and his only remaining son hovered near death; he abandoned his leadership of the city. Gandalf then took it upon himself to direct the defense in cooperation with Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth. When the gigantic ram Grond destroyed Minas Tirith's Great Gate, Gandalf placed himself alone at the ruined gateway. The Witch-king then appeared in the midst of the blasted gate upon a black horse and threatened Gandalf with death; but Gandalf did not move — seated upon Shadowfax he defied the mightiest of Sauron's minions. However, the stand-off ended inconclusively, as the morning arrived along with the host of the Rohirrim. Hearing the horns of the Riders of Rohan, the Witch-king departed.
But Gandalf did not pursue his foe, for Pippin brought him news that Denethor was about to commit suicide in the Houses of the Dead, burning himself and his son Faramir on a pyre like the heathen Kings of old. Gandalf rushed to stop this madness and was able to save Faramir, but not Denethor, whose despair and grief had overcome his mind. Gandalf also learned how it was that Denethor's will had been broken: Denethor clutched a palantír in his hands as he burned. Clearly Denethor had been using the stone's special properties for some time — extending his vision far beyond those of men's eyes, but also wrestling in thought with Sauron. And even though Sauron could not completely overwhelm Denethor's mind, his courage was daunted by knowledge of the vast might of Mordor. Thus the shadow entered into the capital of Gondor.
Nevertheless, and against all hope, the siege was broken. Éowyn of Rohan and the hobbit Merry defeated the Witch-king, whose last wail was heard by many as he was reduced to impotence. Soon after, Aragorn arrived with a large valour of Men from the southern fiefs upon a captured Corsair fleet from Umbar. The forces of the men of the west then utterly defeated Sauron's attack against Minas Tirith, relieving the city and killing virtually all of the invaders. Gandalf's carefully laid plans and words of wisdom, along with acts of heroism not seen since the elder days, had defeated Sauron's first move.
Fall of Sauron
In Minas Tirith, Gandalf was selected by Aragorn, Imrahil, and Éomer (the Captains of the West) to be their leader in the coming final battles. This would be the culmination of Gandalf's efforts in Middle-earth. Fully aware that the west would stand or fall on the outcome of Frodo's mission, he advised the lords to launch an attack against the Morannon, thereby drawing Sauron's eye away from Frodo's likely location. This plan surely would result in a catastrophic loss for the outnumbered army, but it gave Frodo a chance to achieve the quest of Mount Doom.
Gandalf in the final battle at the Black Gate of Mordor
Led by Gandalf and Aragorn, the Army of the West crossed the Anduin and marched north, pausing occasionally to announce their coming and to dispatch small numbers of men to lesser tasks. Upon arriving at the Black Gate, the forces halted and prepared for battle. As they ordered their companies, the foul Mouth of Sauron rode forth to parley with them; he revealed Frodo's Mithril Coat and Sam's Barrow-blade and implied that their owner was captured and tortured. The emissary of Sauron then proposed that the forces of the west surrender; Gandalf however was undaunted, and, seizing his friend's belongings, rejected Sauron's offer. In shock, the Mouth of Sauron turned back towards the Black Gate, which slowly opened to reveal a vast army of Orcs and Trolls advancing on the lords of the west. Sauron's trap was sprung.
Yet Sauron himself became the victim of Gandalf's trap. Unbeknownst to all, Frodo and Sam had succeeded in scaling Mount Doom and even as the Battle of the Black Gate began Frodo stood at the Cracks of Doom. But the power and lure of the Ring finally overcame his will and he placed the Ring upon his finger, claiming it as his own. Immediately the Nazgûl were summoned by their lord, as he in terror realized his blunder: his enemies intended to destroy his Ring.
Gandalf with Gwaihir rescues Frodo and Sam
But Gandalf's foresight proved accurate again as the creature Gollum, who had been doggedly following the Ring-bearer, seized the Ring from Frodo, and, while celebrating his reunion with ""his precious,"" unwittingly fell into the fires of Orodruin. The Ring was unmade as the fiery mountain erupted. The tower of Barad-dûr, the Black Gate and the Towers of the Teeth began to collapse, their foundations crumbling, the Ring-wraiths burned out like shooting stars, and Sauron was reduced to a mere shadow of malice, never to torment the world again. With Sauron gone, his forces scattered like frightened insects; the Men of the West now set upon them with fury. Gandalf announced the success of the Ring-bearer and the end of Sauron; the quest had been fulfilled. Seeing that victory was achieved, Gandalf then mounted on Gwaihir the Eagle for a third time, and set out to see if Frodo and Samwise had survived the tumults of Mount Doom. To his great relief, the two were found on the slopes of Orodruin, clinging to life amid the volcanic eruptions. The great quest was over.
Final deeds
In Minas Tirith, Gandalf and the remaining members of the Fellowship reunited. At the coronation of King Elessar, Gandalf (at Aragorn's request) set the crown upon the King's head, and declared ""Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the Valar endure!"". Thus Gandalf ushered in the new age of Men. Not long after Gandalf led Aragorn to a high hallow on the upper slopes of Mindolluin and there they found a sapling of the White Tree of Gondor, a sign of the renewal that was to come.
After the coronation and wedding of Aragorn to Arwen, Gandalf left with the rest of the remaining Fellowship on the journey home. For Gandalf, it was his last long journey in Middle-earth. His errand had been fulfilled; Sauron had been defeated. He said farewell to his friends one by one until at last only the four Hobbits remained at his side. At the borders of the Shire he, too, turned away. He left the Hobbits to settle with the Shire, for the shattered pieces of evil still remaining in the world were no longer his concern, and went to talk to ""moss gatherer"" Tom Bombadil.
Departing from Middle-earth
What Gandalf did during the next two years is unknown; it is possible that his ""long talk"" with Bombadil was just that. At any rate, on September 29 3021, he met Frodo at the Grey Havens ready to take a White Ship over the sea to Aman. He wore Narya openly on his finger, and Shadowfax was beside him (perhaps even to take ship with him). His mission was over, and his homecoming after more than 2000 years was nigh. He bade farewell to Samwise, Merry, and Pippin (the latter two of whom he had forewarned of the passage), then boarded the ship beside Frodo, Bilbo, Elrond, and was never seen again in Middle-earth.[33]
The ship passed west upon the sea, and then took the hidden straight path to Valinor: Gandalf became Olórin once more. There, presumably, he dwells still in the gardens of Irmo. Olórin, the wisest of the Maiar and the sole Istar to remain true to his mission, had successfully kindled the hearts of the free people in Middle-earth to overcome the evil of their time. In a large way, it was his victory.",
733,"Before the creation of ,Arda","3 November ,3019",Male,White,,Saruman,Maiar,"Isengard,Nan Curunír",,"Origin
Saruman was originally a powerful Maia of Aulë the Smith named Curumo (later in Sindarin, Curunír).[3] From the beginning, he was much like Sauron,[4] being ambitious and cunning, and desiring order.
As Tarindor, Saruman was among the Five Guardians who were sent to reinforce Melian and the already active Guardians in protecting the newly-awakened Elves from Melkor's emissaries.
Third Age
Depiction of Saruman as the Maia Curumo, before leaving Valinor
In Valinor, the land of the Valar, a council was called by Manwë, Eru's regent, shortly after Sauron's defeat by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men at the end of the Second Age. Though the Dark Lord was overthrown, he had not been effectively vanquished. Late in the Third Age, his Shadow began to fall upon Middle-earth a second time. It was decided to send five emissaries to Middle-earth. These should be ""mighty, peers of Sauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh,"" as they were intended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron. The Wizards were forbidden, however, from matching the Dark Lord in power and fear, or trying to dominate the Free Peoples.[1]
Curumo was one of those who volunteered, whereas the last one, Olórin, (later known as ""Gandalf"") was commanded by Manwë to go too. It was from this point that Curumo began to be jealous of Olórin, due to Varda's decision to send Olórin not as the third Istar, but as the second. He also was charged to take Aiwendil (later called ""Radagast"") to please Yavanna, which Curumo did not wish to do, and this led to contempt for the latter Wizard. The others who were chosen were Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards). Curumo then was appointed overall leader of the group.[1]

Arrival in Middle-earth
The arrival of the Istari in Middle-earth
The Five Wizards arrived separately at the Grey Havens in the west of Eriador around the year TA 1000. Curumo appeared first, but apparently neglected to take Aiwendil with him; Aiwendil came later alongside Olórin.[5] Only the keeper of the havens, Círdan the Shipwright, knew Curumo's nature and purpose. Curumo would later discover that Círdan had given Narya, the Red Ring, to Olórin upon their first landing in Middle-earth. Even though Curumo was recognized as the head of the order while Olórin was not, Círdan had divined Olórin as the wisest and greatest of the Istari. Curumo's jealousy of Olórin grew from these events, perhaps because he feared that he would eventually supplant him as chief of the Wizards.
To the Elves, Curumo became known as Curunír, whereas Men called him Saruman, the name by which he was afterwards remembered. The White Messenger and the two Blue Wizards went into the east of Middle-earth. After one and a half millennia, Saruman returned to the west, just as Sauron's power was growing again at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood.
Saruman portrayed by Sir Christopher Lee
The White Council
Yet he is great among the Wise. He is the chief of my order and the head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it, and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small, is his province. — Gandalf the Grey
When the White Council was formed around the year 2463 of the Third Age in order to counter Sauron, Saruman was appointed its leader, though Galadriel wanted Gandalf in this position. Saruman refused to step down due to his pride, while Gandalf had declined; the White Messenger, though, continued to resent the Grey Pilgrim. He also had an intense dislike for Radagast, whom he dismissed as a fool.
At this point Saruman had begun to sense the resurgence of Sauron. This was also the same year that Sauron's One Ring was taken by the Stoor Sméagol (later called Gollum), who disappeared with it into the Misty Mountains for hundreds of years. The White Wizard's extensive research, especially into Ring-lore, had led him to admire the Dark Lord and he fell into the folly of imitating him. Saruman believed he could be the ruler of Middle-earth, in Sauron's likeness, and ""have his own will by force"".[1]
It was during the meetings of the White Council that Saruman first noted Gandalf's interest in Hobbits and the Shire, and believing that all his deeds related to some as yet undisclosed plan of his for self-enhancement, the White Wizard himself began keeping a closer watch on the Grey Pilgrim and sent spies to the Shire to report on all his movements. At first, he himself visited it secretly but stopped when he realized that its inhabitants had noticed him. Amongst the purposes of his visits was to procure some of the halflings' Pipe-weed, since in secret imitation of Gandalf (and for which he publicly belittled him) Saruman had begun to smoke.
At Isengard
Soon after he took up his abode in Isengard. For this, Beren, Steward of Gondor, gave him leave, for Gondor still claimed Isengard as a fortress of its realm, and not part of Rohan. Beren also gave into Saruman's keeping the keys of Orthanc. That tower no enemy had been able to harm or to enter. In this way Saruman began to behave as a lord of Men; for at first he held Isengard as a lieutenant of the Steward and warden of the tower. But Fréaláf was as glad as Beren to have this so, and to know that Isengard was in the hands of a strong friend. A friend he long seemed, and maybe in the beginning he was one in truth.—The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A ""The House of Eorl""
Saruman, as depicted by John Howe
In the year TA 2759, Saruman came to the crowning of Fréaláf Hildeson in Rohan, ""bringing gifts"" and wooing him with flattery. With the permission of both the Steward of Gondor, Beren, and the King of Rohan, Fréaláf, Saruman settled in Orthanc at Isengard as both ""warden of the tower"" and representative of Minas Tirith. Though recognized as an ally by both the Rohirrim and the Gondorians, the Wizard's main goal all along had been to eventually claim the stronghold as his own seat of power.[6] As he had hoped, Saruman also found one of the remaining palantíri in Orthanc, but deceptively concealed his discovery from the rest of the White Council.
In TA 2850, Gandalf entered Dol Guldur and confirmed that the evil presence within was indeed Sauron. Still desiring the One Ring but also desiring to hide his true motives, Saruman advised the White Council against attacking Dol Guldur by deceiving them into believing that the One Ring would never be found. The Grey Pilgrim would later remark that it was at this meeting that he first began to suspect that the White Wizard desired to attain the One Ring. Saruman's real intention was to allow Sauron to build up his strength, so that the Ring would reveal itself and he could claim it first, so he was willing to let Sauron be for the time being.
Concealing his contempt, Saruman persuaded Radagast to teach him how to tame birds and beasts; these he used as spies for his own purposes, unbeknownst to the Brown Wizard.[7] He later found that the Enemy had more knowledge of the possible location of the One Ring than he expected. Therefore, in TA 2941, Saruman finally agreed to an assault upon Dol Guldur. The attack was successful, and by the devices of the White Wizard, the Dark Lord was driven from the fortress.
At the last meeting of the White Council in TA 2953, Saruman claimed that the Ring had been ""passed down Anduin to the Sea"". He then ceased all cooperation with the Wise, taking Isengard for his own and fortifying it. Surrounding himself with ""all who hated Gondor and Rohan"" (i.e. Northern Orcs from the Misty Mountains, Dunlendings and other evil things), Saruman troubled the borders of the Rohirrim during the reign of Thengel and began building his own army. Around TA 2990, Saruman started the ""special breeding"" of Orcs at Isengard and, as Morgoth and Sauron had done before him, crossbred Orcs with Men to make Half-orcs,[4] and eventually his own Uruk-hai, both of which could endure the sunlight.
Jailor of Mordor
A new power is rising. Against it the old allies and policies will not avail us at all. There is no hope left in Elves or dying Númenor. This then is one choice before you, before us. We may join with that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There is hope that way. Its victory is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it.—Saruman, speaking to Gandalf - The Fellowship of the Ring, ""The Council of Elrond""
Saruman the White, by 1oshuart
Soon enough, Sauron, who had returned to Mordor, used the Ithil-stone to establish contact with Saruman's Orthanc-stone. Daunted with threats and lured with promises of power,[8] Saruman submitted to Sauron. Betraying the White Council, the Wizard became one of the Dark Lord's chief agents, desiring or no longer opposing his victory. Though the Wise were suspicious of Saruman's designs concerning the Ring, they were unaware that he was now ""an ally, or servant, of Sauron"", and traitor to them.[9] But Saruman was, in truth, a faithless vassal, who coveted the Ring for himself. The fallen Wizard's endgame was to usurp his ""new master""[2] as Lord of the Rings over Middle-earth. If that gamble failed, Saruman reckoned that he would be the right-hand of Sauron, or rather the true power behind his throne.[10] The Wizard failed to understand that he was little more than the Dark Lord's puppet and would have ultimately been cast aside;[11] Sauron knew, or guessed, Saruman's thoughts ""even without the aid of palantíri or of spies"".[4]
""Saruman of Many Colors"", by TolmanCotton of DeviantArt
Working under orders from Mordor and also eager to expand his own dominion, the  Wizard plotted to ""deliver"" Rohan to his ""dark master"".[2] Aided by his Orcs, Saruman slowly turned Nan Curunír into ""a child's model or a slave's flattery"" of Mordor:[12] trees were cut down and replaced by caverns filled with forges, furnaces and other machines. Around TA 3000, Saruman sent many of his Uruk-hai to join the Northern Orcs and the Mordor-orcs in raiding the eastern villages of Rohan. To further weaken the kingdom, Saruman bought Gríma Wormtongue, Théoden's counselor, with the promise of Éowyn's hand by TA 3014 and used him as a mole in the royal court to sap the king's strength with deceitful advice and poisons. Suspecting a potential connection between the Ring and the Shire (based mostly on Gandalf's interest there), Saruman instructed his agents to infiltrate the Shire and keep tabs on the comings and goings of any important Hobbits. His dealings with Pipe-weed had also earned him allies among the Sackville-Baggins and Bracegirdle families, who owned many plantations. Saruman also used his agents in Eriador to keep watch on the Dúnedain protecting the Shire, as well as to mislead Sauron's more trustworthy informants.[11] Further trying to emulate his master, the Wizard crafted his own lesser ring and similarly styled himself as ""Ring-maker"".[10]
Using the kind-hearted Radagast as an unwitting pawn, Saruman summoned Gandalf to Isengard; so it was that upon Gandalf's arrival, Saruman revealed his betrayal and true intentions, shedding the title of Saruman the White in favour of Saruman of Many Colours. He announced his desire to rule Middle-earth as Sauron's right-hand, or to supplant him using the Ring; he then demanded that the Grey Pilgrim submit to him or to his master. Saruman stated that siding with Sauron would be a wise decision. Gandalf refused both choices, for which Saruman imprisoned him atop Orthanc. This way, Saruman thought he would force Gandalf into revealing the Ring's whereabouts,[10] before sending him as captive to Sauron in Mordor;[2]  Saruman had even revealed to Sauron he ""had got as his prisoner Gandalf"".[11] But Gandalf later escaped with help from Gwaihir the Windlord, one of the Great Eagles, and made Saruman's treachery known to the rest of the Free Peoples at the Council of Elrond.[10]
Beginning of the End
We will have peace, when you and all your works have perished--and the works of your dark master to whom you would deliver us. You are a liar, Saruman, and a corrupter of men's hearts. You hold out your hand to me, and I perceive only a finger of the claw of Mordor. Cruel and cold! Even if your war on me was just--as it was not, for were you ten times as wise you would have no right to rule me and mine for your own profit as you desired--even so, what will you say of your torches in Westfold and the children that lie dead there?—Théoden, The Two Towers, ""The Voice of Saruman""
Saruman making a bomb in his tower, Orthanc
By one account, the Nazgûl came two days after Gandalf's escape, and Saruman used his voice to persuade the Morgul Lord that he did not know the Ring's location. The Wizard boasted that, had he known, he would have already claimed the Ring and the Nine would have submitted to him. Saruman then told them that Gandalf knew, and that they should seek him nearby. Hearing this, the Nazgûl went back on the main road and instead found Gríma, on his way to tell Saruman that Gandalf had been to Edoras. Fearing for his life, Wormtongue revealed that the corrupted Wizard had withheld information and told the Ringwraiths how to reach the Shire.
By another account, Saruman still had Gandalf as a prisoner when the Nazgûl arrived. The Wizard assured the Ringwraiths that he would obtain the Shire's whereabouts from the Grey Pilgrim or hand him over to them. Daunted by the ""full horror of service to Mordor"", Saruman had actually been about to beg Gandalf for forgiveness and help, only to find him gone. Nonetheless, he pretended that the Grey Pilgrim was still there and had just given up the location of the Shire. Saruman believed he now had enough time to try seize the Ring, while still feigning allegiance to Sauron. But the Ringwraiths soon learned that the Wizard knew far more than he had shared with them. On their way to the Shire, the Nazgûl encountered one of Saruman's agents in Eriador, from whom they got detailed maps of the Shire. They sent the spy to Bree after warning him that he was now in the service of Mordor not Isengard; the spy in question was the ill-favored Dunlending at the The Prancing Pony.[11]
Commanded by Sauron, Saruman moved against Théoden to keep Rohan from riding to Gondor's aid. With Gríma preventing any military mobilization within the kingdom, Saruman sent large raiding forces to wreak havoc in the Westfold of Rohan. The only true obstacles to his invasion were Théoden's son and nephew, Théodred and Éomer respectively. As Wormtongue had failed to turn the two men against each other,  the White Wizard tasked his servants to slay the king's heir at all costs. Per this special order, the warriors of Isengard engaged the defenders of Rohan at the Fords of Isen; the First Battle at the Fords of Isen ended in the death of Théodred followed by the retreat of Saruman's hordes. At the same time, the Wizard also betrayed his master: he sent trusted warbands to hunt down the Fellowship and capture the Ring-bearer. Saruman's scouts, led by Uglúk, ambushed the company at Amon Hen, where they took Pippin and Merry captive, while also shooting Boromir ""with many black-feathered arrows"" when he tried to defend the Hobbits. Slowed on their way back to Isengard by conflict with Mordor-orcs loyal to Sauron, the Isengarders were slain on the eaves of Fangorn by Rohirrim led by Éomer. Gimli believed he had glimpsed Saruman at the site of the skirmish, presumably having hastened to claim the Ring from the Hobbits.
Saruman in his tower.
The Wizard's position was becoming dangerously isolated: he lacked the Ring, his neighbors he had ""made [his] enemies"" and he had also ""cheated [his] new master"". Believing he might yet claim lordship over Rohan and regain Sauron's favor by delivering the Rohirrim to him,[2] Saruman intensified his efforts against Théoden. Although Gríma Wormtongue had been ousted as an agent of the Enemy, Rohan had been weakened, allowing Saruman to marshal his full might and unleash his Uruk-hai hordes upon the Rohirrim people at Helm's Deep. Though it initially held the upper hand, Saruman's army was vanquished in the Battle of the Hornburg, its ranks broken by Gandalf's reinforcements. Meanwhile, the Wizard also found his own stronghold under assault. The Ents led by Treebeard besieged Isengard, seeking vengeance for incursions by Orc axemen into Fangorn. These two confrontations led to the end of Saruman's reign of terror in the West, while also costing Sauron a valuable, albeit duplicitous, vassal.
Power destroyed
Your servants are destroyed and scattered; your neighbours you have made your enemies; and you have cheated your new master, or tried to do so. When his eye turns hither, it will be the red eye of wrath. But when I say 'free', I mean 'free': free from bond, of chain or command: to go where you will, even, even to Mordor, Saruman, if you desire. But you will first surrender to me the Key of Orthanc, and your staff. They shall be pledges of your conduct, to be returned later, if you merit them.—Gandalf the White, The Two Towers, ""The Voice of Saruman""
Saruman looks down upon Gandalf from the pinnacle of Orthanc
Following the Ents' destruction of Isengard, Saruman found himself confined to Orthanc and his servants scattered or killed. After the arrival of Théoden, Gandalf, Aragorn, and the remaining members of the Fellowship, Saruman confronted them from the balcony of Orthanc. 
He made one final unsuccessful attempt to bring Théoden under his sway, offering him counsel and friendship. The king refused, recognizing him as a pawn of Sauron and demanding justice for the atrocities Saruman had committed against the Rohirrim. Gandalf offered Saruman a chance at redemption, which involved surrendering his staff and the Key of Orthanc as a pledge, in exchange for freedom to head wherever he pleased - even to Mordor. Saruman had a moment of doubt but in the end pride, envy, fear and hate won over and he refused the chance of redemption.[2] Moreover, he did not want to ""appear a rebel"" to his master and suffer his wrath.[8]
Saruman's staff broken by Gandalf
Gandalf, who had returned from death to accomplish the mission Saruman did not, expelled the turncoat from the ranks of the Istari and the White Council and broke his staff. Saruman also lost the palantír of Orthanc when Gríma threw it off a balcony, undecided about which he hated more, Saruman or Gandalf, and hitting neither.[2] With no captive to send nor palantír to ""answer the summons"", Saruman had no means of appeasing Sauron. He thus locked himself in Orthanc, living in terror of both the Free Peoples and his master.[8]

Final fall
Left out of the final stages of the War of the Ring, Saruman eventually managed to persuade the Ents holding him captive to let him and his servant Gríma leave Isengard after he handed to them the Key of Orthanc. He went thence to the Shire, which his ally Lotho Sackville-Baggins had brought under control. Powerless to directly avenge himself on Gandalf, Saruman instead resolved to hurt the Hobbits of whom Gandalf was so fond. To this end, he spent his final days as a criminal master in Hobbiton known as Sharkey (from the Orkish sharkû, meaning ""old man""), disposing of Lotho Sackville-Baggins through Gríma. But his reign of terror came to an end with his overthrow in the Battle of Bywater, after which Frodo confronted Saruman and exiled him from the Shire. Saruman agreed to leave. However, when Frodo attempts to convince Gríma that he no longer needs to serve Saruman, Saruman exposes Grima's murder of Lotho Sackville-Baggins. Gríma argued that Saruman made him do that, but Saruman mocked him and slapped him down. As Saruman began to walk, a now rageful Gríma, who finally had enough of Saruman's physical and verbal abuse, slit his throat from behind with a dagger, leading to the end of the traitorous and corrupted Wizard.
After Saruman's departure from Orthanc, King Elessar entered the tower with the intent of re-ordering it. Inside, Elessar's men found many treasures that Saruman had stolen from Rohan. The original Elendilmir, presumed lost forever when Isildur perished in the Gladden Fields, was also found, as well as a golden chain presumed to have once borne the One Ring. It was suspected that, during his search for the Ring near the Anduin, Saruman had discovered the remains of Isildur and burnt them out of scorn, keeping only his possessions.
Fate
As a Maia, Saruman could not really die. His spirit separated from his body much like Sauron's did after the fall of Númenor. As an incorporeal spirit, he should have been called to the Halls of Mandos, but it is implied that he was barred from returning. It is indicated that his spirit was left naked, powerless and wandering, never to return to Middle-earth:
Whereas Curunir was cast down, and utterly humbled, and perished at last by the hand of an oppressed slave; and his spirit went whither-soever it was doomed to go, and to Middle-earth, whether naked or embodied, came never back.—Saruman's fate",
734,Before the creation of Arda,Immortal,Male, ,,Tilion,Ainur,,,"Tilion was originally a Maia of Oromë the Huntsman, and resided in Valinor throughout the Years of the Trees, and into the beginning of the Third Age. He loved to wander through the Gardens of Lórien, and dream next to Lórellin, in the glittering silver rays of Telperion.[1] He was said to be less mighty than Arien, who was chosen by the Valar to be the guardian of the Sun. When the Two Trees of Valinor were destroyed, Tilion rescued the last surviving flower of Telperion. Aulë decided to craft the Moon first, so it was seen rising and setting seven times before the Sun rose its first. However, Morgoth was angered and scared of the new lights in the sky, so he launched an attack on them, sending his dark servants after them. It was said that Arien easily burned away the dark powers, but Tilion was waylaid and hard-pressed to hold his own, but still managed to pull through.[1] However, he was, and still is to this day somewhat reckless, not always following the Moon's direct, intended path across the sky, which causes the Moon to be occasionally visible at the same time as the Sun, or to not appear at all, or even to block the light of Arien.
Tilion may have been the inspiration for the Man in the Moon, a figure appearing in the folk-lore of Gondor and The Shire.[2]",

""Nothing is evil in the beginning. Even Sauron was not so.""
—The Fellowship of the Ring, ""The Council of Elrond""
Sauron's original name was Mairon. He was the mightiest Maia of the Vala Aulë the Smith, and learned much from Aulë of smithing and handiwork, becoming a great craftsman and ""mighty in the lore of"" Aulë's people.[2] He was among the most powerful Maiar.
""Mairon"", as depicted by Elena Kukanova.
In the Days before days, Mairon was as Eru had created him: good and noble. His greatest virtue was his love of order and perfection, and dislike of anything wasteful. However, this would also prove to be the cause of his betrayal and downfall, as Mairon saw in Melkor the will and power that would help him achieve his personal ends quicker than if he pursued them alone. However, while Melkor wanted to either control or destroy Middle-earth itself, Mairon's desire was to dominate the minds and wills of its creatures for what he perceived to be their own benefit. To see his marvelous designs through, Mairon sought to increase his innate power, so he betrayed the Valar and joined Melkor, soon becoming his chief agent.
After allying himself with Melkor, Mairon feigned loyalty to the Valar, which allowed him to secretly inform his master of his dealings with them. When Melkor established his strongholds in Middle-earth, Mairon left Valinor and openly declared his allegiance, becoming a recognized foe of the Valar.
First Age
""In all the deeds of Melkor the Morgoth upon Arda, in his vast works and in the deceits of his cunning, Sauron had a part, and was only less evil than his master in that for long he served another and not himself.""
—The Silmarillion, Valaquenta, ""Of the Enemies""
As Melkor's lieutenant, Sauron commanded the fortress of Angband.[3] It was with Sauron's aid that Melkor was able to breed Orcs, in mockery of the Children of Ilúvatar.[4] At the beginning of the Battle of the Powers, Sauron feigned a resistance against the Valar at Angband, thus allowing Melkor to muster forces at Utumno unnoticed.[5] After both Angband and Utumno were sacked and Melkor captured, Sauron was not found; in their haste to both capture the Dark Lord and remove him from Middle-earth, the Valar overlooked Sauron's escape.[3]
Sauron ""controlled things"" in Melkor's absence:[6] Angband's reconstruction began, and the Orcs there multiplied under his command.[7] Possibly aware of the Great March, Sauron may have harried the Elves on their journey, directing Melkor's servants abroad or affecting the weather.[8] The Sindar Elves in Beleriand called him Gorthaur, meaning ""dread abomination"",[9] while others of the Eldar had named him Sauron, meaning ""the abhorred"" or ""the abominable"" (a mockery of his original name). Under Sauron's regency, Angband was almost ready by YT 1495,[6] with Orc armies already prepared by him when Morgoth (Melkor) returned.[7]
Sauron as Morgoth's lieutenant in the First Age, by Eric Faure-Brac
Towards the end of the First Age, the Ñoldor Elves left the Blessed Realm of Valinor in the Utter West (against the counsel of the Valar) in order to wage war on Morgoth following his theft of the Silmarils of Fëanor, enchanted gems that glowed with light from the now-destroyed Trees of Valinor. In that war, Sauron was counted as the ""greatest of [Morgoth's] servants that have names"" and was soon feared as a lord of phantoms and dreadful beasts, a shape-shifter and sorcerer.
When Morgoth left Angband much later to corrupt the newly awakened Atani (Men), Sauron directed the war against the Elves.[10] Commanding ""a host of Balrogs"" by one account,[11] he seized the Elvish isle of Tol Sirion from its warden, Orodreth, and turned it into Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the Isle of werewolves.[12] There he established himself as the Lord of werewolves, with both Draugluin, sire of the werewolves, and Thuringwethil, a Vampire herald, at his side.
After the Dagor Bragollach in FA 456, Sauron was bidden by Morgoth to destroy Barahir, ally of Finrod, King of Nargothrond; Sauron ensnared Gorlim, who was captured by his hunters, and interrogated him about the outlaw-lord's location. Gorlim refused to tell them anything, even under torture, until Sauron himself came forth and bartered with the man. Gorlim asked for his wife Eilinel, whom he thought captured. Thus, Sauron agreed and Gorlim yielded the information. However, Morgoth's agent then revealed that Eilinel was dead, and he put Gorlim to death afterward. Sauron then sent Gorgol the Butcher's horde to slay Barahir and his company. Barahir's son, Beren, evaded this fate and after news of his deeds reached Morgoth, Sauron at the helm of an army of Orcs, werewolves and other fell beasts started hunting him.
In the Quest for the Silmaril, Beren and Finrod were captured by Sauron when they tried to sneak past Tol-in-Gaurgoth in Orc disguises. Sauron then defeated Finrod in a duel with songs of power, as told in The Lay of Leithian. Striping them of their stolen garb, he cast them into the dungeons where Werewolves devoured their companions; Morgoth's vassal hoped to terrify them into revealing their quest. When one of Sauron's werewolves came to attack Beren, Finrod wrestled with and killed it, but died soon after of his injuries.
Sauron, as a werewolf, defeated by Huan - by Ted Nasmith
Soon afterward, Lúthien and Huan the wolfhound arrived at the bridge of Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Sauron sent his servants to capture Lúthien, but all were slain by Huan, including Draugluin, but he fled and told his master that Huan was there. Sauron was aware of the prophecy that stated that Huan could not be slain save by the greatest wolf that had ever lived. As such, Sauron took the form of a werewolf and resolved to kill Huan and capture Lúthien. His form was so monstrous that as he charged down the bridge even Huan was forced to spring aside. But Lúthien possessed the ability to cast spells of sleep, and had one such spell active upon her when Sauron attacked. Sauron was momentarily impacted by the spell as he lunged at her, and Huan took advantage of this brief distraction to leap upon Sauron.
In the end Huan took Sauron by the throat and subdued him, and though Sauron attempted to shapeshift into a serpent and escape, Huan's grip upon his throat was too strong. Lúthien demanded then that Sauron yield to her the tower and the isle. She knew that Huan could not kill Sauron; as a Maia he was immortal. But she knew as well that Sauron had built up a great deal of power in his corporeal form, and that if Huan destroyed it, that power would be lost. So she mocked him with the possibility of having to flee back to Angband, powerless and without a body, to endure the scorn of Morgoth. Ultimately, Sauron was not willing to endure such shame, and chose to surrender Tol-in-Gaurhoth to her rather than have his flesh destroyed. Huan released him and he fled in the form of a ""vampire"".[13]

""He repents in fear when the First Enemy is utterly defeated, but in the end does not do as was commanded, return to the judgement of the gods. He lingers in Middle-earth. ""
—The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, ""Letter 131""
After his defeat by Lúthien, Sauron played little part in the events of the First Age (possibly hiding from Morgoth's scorn or wrath). After his former master was defeated and taken to Valinor in chains at the end of the First Age, Sauron approached the victorious Host of the West and pled with Eönwë for mercy. However, Eönwë did not have the authority to pardon a being of his own order, and commanded Sauron to return to Aman to be judged by the Valar. It is not known for certain whether Sauron was genuinely repentant, daunted by the Host's victory, or some combination of the two. Regardless however, Sauron's pride and fear ultimately won out and instead of returning to Valinor, he fled and hid in Middle-earth.[14]
Second Age
Forging of the One Ring
""Very slowly, beginning with fair motives: the reorganising and rehabilitation of the ruin of Middle-earth, 'neglected by the gods', he becomes a reincarnation of evil, and a thing lusting for Complete Power – and so consumed ever more  fiercely with hate (especially of gods and Elves). ""
—The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, ""Letter 131""
After remaining hidden and dormant for five centuries, Sauron began revealing himself once more. At first his wishes were those of a reformer: he fancied that, with ""the Valar (including Melkor) having failed"", he would reorganize and heal Middle-earth. But his pride became boundless and his lust for absolute power, initially only the means to a noble end, became the end itself. He desired to be a god-king and to be worshipped by all rational creatures. Sauron's hatred for the Valar grew, regarding ""the motives of Manwë as precisely the same as his own"".
""A new shadow arises in the East. It is no tyranny of evil Men, as your son believes; but a servant of Morgoth is stirring, and evil things wake again. Each year it gains in strength, for most Men are ripe to its purpose.""
—Gil-galad, Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife
By SA 1000, he had gathered power and established himself in the land of Mordor, in eastern Middle-earth, and began building the dreaded Barad-dûr near Mount Doom. He gathered to his service all the Orcs ""scattered far and wide in the Northern world"" were under his dominion,[15][16] as well as Trolls and other creatures from the days of Morgoth; Sauron also gained the allegiance of certain races of Men such as the Easterlings, ""of old corrupted by Morgoth"", and the Haradrim by promising them plunder, wealth and power.
Annatar as imagined by Maureval
Although Sauron knew that Men were easier to sway, he sought to bring the Elves into his service, as they were far more powerful than any Men save the Númenóreans. By about SA 1500, Sauron deceptively put on a fair visage and called himself Annatar, the ""Lord of Gifts"". It is said that as Annatar he assumed the guise of an emissary of the Valar, ironically ""anticipating the Istari"".[17]
He befriended the Elf smiths of Eregion including Celebrimbor, a descendant of Fëanor and the greatest living craftsman. Sauron would go on to counsel them in both new forms of metallurgy and magic. Not all the Elves trusted him, particularly Lady Galadriel, Elrond, and Gil-galad, High King of the Ñoldor. Some accounts say that he befriended the Elven smiths of Gwaith-i-Mírdain without the knowledge of Galadriel and Celeborn.[17]  In one version of the story, Sauron developed such a strong hold over Gwaith-i-Mírdain that he persuaded them to rebel against Galadriel and Celeborn which drove them to leave Eregion so he could work unopposed.[17] Regardless, the smiths of Eregion gave themselves over to learning from him just as their ancestors had trusted and learned from Morgoth.
This is the Master-ring, the One Ring to rule them all. This is the One Ring that he lost many ages ago, to the great weakening of his power. He greatly desires it – but he must not get it.—Gandalf the Grey, The Lord of the Rings, ""The Shadow of the Past""
Eventually, Sauron gave the Elven smiths he worked with the knowledge and encouragement to forge magic Rings, which he infused with potent spells without their knowledge. These included the great Rings of Power while he deceitfully forged the One Ring in secret, to rule the Elvish rings. Upon that ring Sauron wrote in Tengwar the Black Speech inscription,
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
This translates as:
One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.
The One Ring worn by Sauron
However, as soon as he put on his Ring the Elves sensed his treachery, and removed their Rings and hid them. Having raised the fortress of Barad-dûr in Mordor in SA 1600, Sauron then prepared ninety years for open war; his gathering of armies was opposed by the two ""powerful enemies behind his back"" in the East and South.[18]  The Elves managed to hide the three greatest of the Rings from him, but the other sixteen Rings of Power were either captured by Sauron, destroyed, or lost. To the Dwarves he had given Seven, but to Men he had given Nine, knowing that they would be the easiest to corrupt.
Despite having given Rings to the greatest of the Dwarven rulers, whatever plans Sauron had devised for the Dwarves would not come to pass. For when Aulë had crafted the fathers of the Dwarves, he had made them exceedingly sturdy of both mind and body in order to resist the predations, both physical and spiritual, of Morgoth's dark servants. This proved to be exceedingly fortunate for the Dwarves, for the Dwarf-lords who received the Rings did not fade and could not be influenced by Sauron even while he wore the One Ring. However, the Dwarves did not escape Sauron's maleficence unscathed, for the Rings kindled in the hearts of those who possessed them an insatiable lust for gold. Though this would make many of the Dwarven kingdoms exceedingly prosperous for a time, the obsession of the Dwarven ring-bearers with gold would ultimately bring much grief to their race. As Sauron predicted however, all nine of the Men to whom he had given Rings fell under his sway and became the Nazgûl, his deadliest servants.
Annatar, by Soni Alcorn-Hender
Having grown ""'greater', effectively"" than Morgoth at the end,[19] Sauron conquered nearly all of Middle-earth, with only Gil-galad's realm of Lindon being safe from his grasp. At his height during the Accursed Years, became known as the Dark Lord to the Free Peoples. However, he had not expected the intervention of the Númenóreans, scions of the Edain (and partial descendants through Elros, of Beren and Lúthien). The armies of the King of Númenor, Tar-Minastir, defeated Sauron's forces in the Battle of the Gwathló in SA 1700. Beaten but not wholly vanquished, Sauron fled back to Mordor with only his bodyguard and began rebuilding his strength over the next centuries.
""When [Ar-Pharazôn] learned that Sauron had taken the title of King of Kings and Lord of the World, he resolved to put down the 'pretender'.""
—The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, ""Letter 131""
Towards the end of the Second Age, he was once again powerful enough to raise large armies to attempt to conquer Middle-earth. By this time, he assumed the titles of ""Lord of the Earth"" and ""King of Men"". He once again conquered nearly all of Middle-earth but his harassment of a number of Númenorian settlements along the western coasts brought him to the attention of Ar-Pharazôn, the most powerful King of Númenor the world had yet seen. Insulted by Sauron's claim to both dominion of the world and the title of ""King of Men"", when Ar-Pharazôn considered himself to be the true bearer of that mantle, Ar-Pharazôn decided to challenge Sauron and force him to swear fealty.
Sauron's fair disguise, by Ralph Damiani
Life in Númenor
Ar-Pharazôn mustered an astounding Númenórean army that utterly eclipsed even Sauron's own. In SA 3261, the King landed in Umbar in Middle-earth with his troops and began the trek to Mordor. Sauron's armies were so overmatched that his forces fled from the Númenóreans as they approached Mordor, and it became quite clear to Sauron that he could not best Ar-Pharazôn by force. Thus when Ar-Pharazôn sent messengers to Barad-dûr demanding that Sauron acknowledge the Númenórean King's overlordship, Sauron descended from his fortress without any offer of battle and assumed a fair form. His appearance, mannerisms and flattery of the King confused and astonished the Númenóreans, for rumor of Sauron portrayed him to be anything but what he now presented. However, Ar-Pharazôn was not so entranced by Sauron's obsequiousness as his generals, and he demanded that Sauron come back to Númenor as a hostage.
Sauron feigned unhappiness at this development but was secretly delighted, for this presented him with an opportunity to destroy the Númenóreans from within. After only a few short years in Númenor he grew from captive to the King's most trusted adviser, and nearly all the King's court fawned upon him. Drawing on their fear of Death, he deceitfully converted many Númenóreans to the worship of Morgoth by lying that Morgoth had the power to save them from their mortality. As his power and influence reached its peak, he raised a great Temple for Morgoth in which he performed human sacrifices to the Dark Lord. Finally, he manipulated and deceived Ar-Pharazôn to rebel against the Valar and attack Valinor itself and claim it for himself.

Sauron trying to kill Isildur
But here, Eru directly intervened—Númenor was drowned under the sea, and the great navy of Númenor was destroyed and the army that reached Aman was buried under mountains of falling rock and said to be imprisoned in the Caves of the Forgotten. The world was bent, so that thereafter, only Elven-ships could sail into the Utter West. Sauron's body was destroyed, but his spirit was not diminished, and he fled back to Mordor bearing the Ring, where he slowly rebuilt a new body and strength. Hereafter, he lost the ability to assume a fair shape, and ruled now through terror and force. A few Faithful Númenóreans led by Elendil were saved from the flood, and they founded two Realms in Exile, Arnor and Gondor, in Middle-earth. Ultimately, despite losing his ability to present himself as fair, Sauron had achieved an overwhelming victory in destroying Númenor, which rid him of his most powerful opposition by far in ruling Middle-earth.
Sauron battling Elendil and Gil-galad on Mount Doom's slopes, by Kip Rasmussen
Loss of the Ring
After learning that Elendil, whom he had especially hated in Númenor, had survived and was ordering a realm on his borders, Sauron made war on Arnor and Gondor. However during his absence in Númenor, Gil-galad, High King of the Ñoldor, had significantly increased the power of his own realm. In his haste to prevent Elendil from strengthening his kingdoms, Sauron alerted Gil-galad to his return before his forces were fully prepared. Now aware of Sauron's resurgent threat, Gil-galad allied with Elendil to create the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and together they marched across Middle-earth to attack Sauron. They defeated his armies in the Battle of Dagorlad, and then invaded Mordor and laid siege to Barad-dûr for seven years. Finally, Sauron himself came forth and dueled with both Elendil and Gil-galad and slew them, shattering Elendil's sword Narsil beneath him as he fell. However, Sauron was so badly wounded in turn that he was not able to stop Isildur, Elendil's son, from cutting the One Ring from his finger with one of Narsil's shards. This destroyed Sauron's physical body, but his spirit endured and fled. Sauron's remaining forces were routed soon afterwards, and Barad-dûr was leveled to its foundations.
Sauron defeated, after the One Ring was cut from his hand
Third Age
""The Dark Lord is no longer on his throne, but his monsters are not wholly destroyed, and his dreadful servants, slaves of the Ring, endure as shadows among the shadows. ""
—The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, ""Letter 131""
Despite this defeat, the Dark Lord still was not fully vanquished. So long as the Ring existed, Sauron's spirit would always have the ability to endure and take shape once more. For the first millennium of the Third Age he lay in hiding, slowly recovering strength until he regained enough power to direct his old servants, the Nazgûl and other evil creatures (""orcs and trolls [...] wargs and werewolves""),[20] against the Free Peoples.
The Necromancer of Dol Guldur
Sauron's appearance as ""the Necromancer""
In TA 1000, Sauron became active once more, occupying the stronghold of Dol Guldur, the Hill of Sorcery, in southern Mirkwood in TA 1050, and working in secret. There, he used the guise of a dreaded sorcerer, called ""the Necromancer"", and the Elves did not yet discern that he was the Dark Lord returned. Around the same time, the Valar sent five Maiar as the Order of Wizards,  to rally the Free Peoples of the World in countering his potential re-emergence. Though Sauron dismissed their presence ""as a mere effort of defeated imperialists"" (seemingly justified in the case of their chief, Saruman), Gandalf arose among them as ""the Enemy of Sauron"".
While the Dark Lord continued to scheme and gather strength, the Nine reappeared in TA 1300, and began steadily assaulting the Númenórean kingdoms in exile at his behest, ultimately destroying the North-kingdom of Arnor and gravely weakening the South-kingdom of Gondor. In the same period, foul things that still walked the earth or beneath it were stirred: the Northern Orcs of the Misty Mountains grew bolder in their incursions, while secretly raising strongholds and barring the passes between Eriador and the Vales of Anduin ""according to the plan of their master in Dol Guldur""; the Dragons laid waste to the Dwarven mansions, consuming three of the Seven Dwarf-rings and claiming the treasure hoards. Guided by the emissaries of the Dark Lord, the Easterlings and other wicked Men also renewed their bitter feud with the Gondorians and Northmen, launching fresh attacks on the western lands.
""Before you could get round in the South, you would get into the land of the Necromancer, and even you, Bilbo, won't need me to tell you tales of that black sorcerer. I don't advise you to go anywhere near the places overlooked by his dark tower!""
—Gandalf, The Hobbit, ""Queer Lodgings""
The Dark Lord's Ring
Suspecting that Sauron had indeed returned and that his hand coordinated the steady resurgence of evil, such as the actions of the Nazgûl, Gandalf infiltrated Dol Guldur in TA 2063 to confirm his suspicion, but the Dark Lord fled eastwards to conceal his identity. This marked the beginning of the Watchful Peace, which ended with Sauron's return to Dol Guldur in TA 2460 with renewed strength. In the same year, the One Ring was finally discovered by the Stoor Sméagol and his friend, Déagol. Sméagol murdered Déagol and took the Ring for himself. Sméagol was eventually so changed by the Ring's corruption he was given the name Gollum, ostracized from his people, and dwelt secluded, deep within the Misty Mountains. With Durin's Folk driven out from Khazad-dûm by Durin's Bane, Sauron began ""to people Moria with his creatures"" around TA 2480; it is quite possible that the Balrog itself ""had been awakened by the malice of Sauron"".

""Far away here, I wonder if you fully realize the strength of a great Dragon. But that is not all: there is a Shadow growing fast in the world far more terrible. They will help one another.""
—Gandalf to Thorin II, Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth, ""The Quest of Erebor""
Following the sack of Erebor, Gandalf felt that Sauron would take advantage of Middle-earth's weakened state: Arnor was no more, leaving Rivendell and Lothlórien open to an attack, and the Dwarves of the Iron Hills were the only obstacle in regaining Angmar. Above all else however, he feared that Sauron would eventually forge an alliance with the dragon Smaug, whom the Dark Lord could use to terrible effect.[21] In TA 2850, Gandalf entered Dol Guldur again and finally confirmed that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron himself. Eventually, the White Council put forth their strength and, with Saruman's approval, attacked Dol Guldur in TA 2941[22][23] in the hopes of ousting Sauron before he and Smaug could ""help one another"".[24] The Wise were able to oust the weakened Sauron from Dol Guldur with relative ease, but Sauron had had ample time to prepare for their assault, and only feigned retreat, abandoning Dol Guldur willingly. He returned secretly to Mordor, where he would openly declare himself in TA 2951, and began preparations for his final war to dominate Middle-earth.[23] However, shortly after Sauron's retreat from Dol Guldur, Smaug would be slain by Bard the First, eliminating the Dark Lord's most powerful potential ally.
War of the Ring
Sauron and his servants, as depicted in a wallpaper for The Lord of the Rings: Rise to War.
""Now of late we have learned that the Enemy has been among [the Southrons], and they are gone over to Him, or back to Him-they were ever ready to His will-as have so many also in the East. I doubt not that the days of Gondor are numbered, and the walls of Minas Tirith are doomed, so great is His strength and malice.""
—The Two Towers, ""Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit""
Sauron bred immense armies of Orcs and other evil creatures and rallied Men from the east and south - many of which had served him in the past - to his banner. He also gathered his most terrifying servants, the Nazgûl, or Ringwraiths, each wearing one of the nine rings conceived for mortal Men. From among the Nine, Sauron sent Khamûl, the Second Chief, to resettle Dol Guldur and prepare it for war against Thranduil's neighbouring realm. He once again adopted the symbol of a lidless eye, and as he exerted his will over Middle-earth, the Eye of Sauron was recognized by all as a symbol of power and fear.
As part of his strategy against the kingdoms of Men, Sauron began to weaken Gondor by influencing Denethor II. Using the Palantír of Minas Ithil, the Dark Lord convinced the Ruling Steward, current owner of the Anor-stone, of his imminent victory; Denethor gradually succumbed to despair.
""Saruman fell under the domination of Sauron and desired his victory, or no longer opposed it.""
—Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth, ""The Palantíri""
By TA 3000, the ""shadow of Mordor reached out to Rohan"".  Through the Ithil-stone, Sauron communed with Saruman, who held the Orthanc-stone, and compelled him to betray the White Council and serve him with promises of power and ""rich reward"".[25] Having become the Wizard's ""dark master"",[26]  Sauron then commanded Saruman to subjugate Rohan and form in Isengard a second pincer to crush Gondor. For the time being, Sauron tolerated the fact that Saruman was actually a faithless servant that coveted the Ring, as he could ""read his thought even when he withheld information.""[27]
The Ringwraiths in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring film
After Gollum was captured, Sauron had him tortured and learned that he once had a magic ring, and, from him, he heard the words Shire and Baggins. He deduced that Gollum's ring was the One Ring and released the creature in TA 3017, hoping that Gollum would unwittingly lead him to Baggins. But Gollum's trail was lost in the Dead Marshes, ""where Sauron's emissaries. could not or would not follow him."" The Dark Lord then learned that the creature had been captured by his enemies. Sauron decided to send the dreaded Nazgûl, to find the Shire and search for Baggins. To conceal the Nazgûl's mission and test Denethor's strength, Sauron launched an assault against Osgiliath in TA 3018. At the same time, his servants in Dol Guldur attacked Thranduil's realm, where Gollum was held, with orders to ""to capture or kill Gollum"". The creature, however, escaped both the Dark Lord and his enemies.[27]
Although the Nazgûl found the Shire and came close to capturing Baggins at Weathertop, they ultimately failed to retrieve the Ring and thus returned to the Dark Lord empty-handed. Sauron then sent a Mordor-orc warband led by Grishnákh to join a group of Isengarders that was tracking down the Fellowship of the Ring. The Orcs ambushed the company at Amon Hen and successfully captured two Hobbits, but were slowed down by internal strife - partially caused by Saruman's disloyalty - and later slain on the eaves of Fangorn Forest by the Rohirrim.
Having ""cheated [his] new master"" by trying to claim the Ring for himself,[26] Saruman made a final assault against Théoden King at Helm's Deep in hopes of conquering Rohan for Sauron and regaining his favor. The Wizard was defeated by the Rohirrim and Ents however, costing the Dark Lord one of his most powerful vassals, as well the large army of Isengard.
Aragorn reveals himself to Sauron through the palantír
Shortly after Saruman's defeat, Peregrin Took looked into the Orthanc-stone and accidentally communicated with Sauron. At first, the Dark Lord believed he was talking to his servant and reprimanded him for neglecting to report. Realizing that the other surveyor was a Hobbit, Sauron then assumed that Pippin was Saruman's prisoner and tried to coerce information out of him. But shortly thereafter Aragorn took the palantír and revealed himself to Sauron, and seeing Aragorn, the Dark Lord concluded that his vassal had fallen and that Isildur's heir possessed the One Ring. Fearing that his enemies would use the Ring against him, Sauron sped up his plans and attacked the city of Minas Tirith in Gondor sooner than he had planned, seeking to raze the city and crush the last human resistance to his rule before his enemies could fortify it, and to prevent the Men of the West uniting under one king.
Due to the combined efforts of Gondor, Rohan, and the Dúnedain of Arnor, Sauron's army was defeated. Despite still possessing more than enough military strength to destroy Minas Tirith and easily conquer Middle-earth once Gondor fell, doubt began to grow in Sauron. As such, he watched and waited, hoping for a period of strife between Aragorn and other potential Ringlords in which he could move out and take the Ring for himself.
Downfall
""If it [the Ring] is destroyed, then he will fall, and his fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising ever again. For he will lose the best part of the strength that was native to him in his beginning, and all that was made or begun with that power will crumble, and he will be maimed for ever, becoming a mere spirit of malice that gnaws itself in the shadows, but cannot again grow or take shape. And so a great evil of this world will be removed.""
—The Return of the King, ""The Last Debate""
Despite their successful repulse of Sauron's armies at Minas Tirith, Gandalf and Aragorn knew that the bulk of Sauron's forces remained in Mordor, readying themselves for another, deadlier strike against the city. Filled as Mordor was with Sauron's troops, Frodo Baggins stood almost no chance of reaching Mount Doom undetected. In light of the situation, Aragorn called for a council consisting of the major commanders of all the forces present in Minas Tirith, and appointed Gandalf to be their commander until the crisis had passed. Gandalf made it clear to all those present that, despite their great victory, they ultimately could not hope to defeat Sauron's armies by force. Therefore, they had two options available. They could station their remaining force, considerably greater than it had been before the battle due to the reinforcements from Rohan and southern Gondor, at Minas Tirith and hope to endure Sauron's next attack. Or, they could take a force to the Black Gate and attempt to challenge Sauron directly.
This force, as Gandalf suggested, would only need to be great enough to offer battle, and the rest of their forces could remain behind to garrison Minas Tirith. This option, though suicidal for those involved, would serve to distract Sauron from gazing into his own land, through which the Ring Bearer would be traveling. Furthermore, Gandalf theorised that, once Sauron learned that a force too small to pose any real threat to him was on its way to the Black Gate to directly assault Mordor, he would likely believe that the leader of the attacking force would have the One Ring in their possession. Sauron would assume that the Ring itself would influence its wielder, who, in his pride and overconfidence in his newfound power, might be foolish enough to challenge Sauron's might with a force too small to assault Mordor in earnest.[28]
Their plot worked, as Sauron marshaled most of his remaining forces and marched them towards Udûn to crush the Men of the West and regain his prize. This action left the Plains of Gorgoroth largely unguarded, allowing Frodo and Sam to reach Mount Doom with far less difficulty than otherwise. However, once Frodo reached the Cracks of Doom, he finally succumbed to the power of the Ring, and put it on. Immediately, Sauron became aware of the halfling, and turned his gaze towards the mountain. He frantically sent the Ringwraiths to retrieve the Ring, but was too late, as Gollum, after taking the Ring from Frodo, slipped and fell to his death into the Cracks of Doom. The Ring was unmade. The earth shook as a great shock wave rippled across Mordor, and the foundations of Barad-dûr were finally destroyed, causing the great fortress to fall into ruin once and for all. The cone of Mount Doom burst apart in a cataclysmic eruption that consumed the eight remaining Nazgûl.[29]
Sauron's shadow looming over the Army of the West before being blown away
With his source of power gone, Sauron was utterly defeated and his armies bereft of the driving will behind their conquest were swollowed up by the earth and destroyed. With the One Ring destroyed, Sauron was permanently robbed of his physical form, reducing him to a malevolent spirit that hovered above Mordor as a ""huge shape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning-crowned, ...terrible but impotent,"" only to be blown away by a great wind;[30] he had ended on the same path as his old master, Morgoth, and was condemned to a sleepless impotent malice that feeds on itself.
With the destruction of the Ring, the vast majority of Sauron's being and his power was forever lost. With that, Sauron's spirit no longer had the power to create a new body and take shape again. Though his indestructible mind and being were bound forever to Eä, Sauron had lost all power to effect his will upon the world and could never again grow in strength.",
736,"Before the creation of ,Arda",Immortal,Male,,,Eönwë,Ainur,,,"Eönwë was referred to as the ""greatest of arms in Arda,"" meaning that he was the best with weapons, but as one of the Maiar he was not necessarily the most powerful in might.[1] When Eärendil reached the shores of Aman to make his appeal, it was Eönwë who first greeted him outside of Tirion praising his arrival and accomplishments. When Manwë decided to heed the appeal, Eönwë was sent to Middle-earth to fight the War of Wrath, leading the Host of the Valar.
When Morgoth was defeated, Eönwë took the two remaining Silmarils and held them for safekeeping. The two remaining Sons of Fëanor took them and fled, yet Eönwë did not let them be slain, hoping they would see the folly of their ways.[2] After the War of Wrath, Sauron emerged from hiding and approached Eönwë seeking forgiveness, but Eönwë did not have the authority to pardon him alone, and told him he would have to return to the Valar to receive judgment, but Sauron fled from him instead.[3]
Eönwë also possessed great wisdom and taught the remaining Edain many things, enriching them with great knowledge before the raising of Númenor.[4]",

Durin's Bane was one of the Maiar spirits that existed before the world was created (of the same race as Gandalf and Saruman), who descended into Arda with the Valar. It was eventually seduced and corrupted by Melkor, becoming one of the Valaraukar and joining with the other Balrogs in Morgoth's service. The Balrog likely fought in many battles of the War of the Great Jewels, up to and including the War of Wrath. It somehow managed to survive Morgoth's defeat, fleeing east and taking refuge beneath the Misty Mountains.
The Dwarves' first contact with the Balrog as depicted by Robert Zigo
Third Age[]
For more than five thousand years, the Balrog lay dormant at the roots of the Misty Mountains beneath the Dwarven kingdom of Khazad-dûm. It remained undisturbed throughout the Second Age and most of the Third Age, until the Dwarves awoke it in TA 1980 when they mined too deeply and too greedily in their search for mithril. It slew Durin VI that year, and his son Náin I attempted to destroy it a year later in TA 1981. He was also slain by the Balrog, after this the Dwarves of Durin's Folk abandoned their ancient home.
In TA 2799 after the Battle of Azanulbizar, Thráin II wished to re-enter Moria, but was stopped by Dáin Ironfoot, who alone had reached the threshold and saw the waiting Balrog.
Durin's Bane before Gandalf on the Bridge, by Xavier Collette
In January of TA 3019, the Fellowship of the Ring traveled through Moria on their way to Mordor. There, they were attacked in the Chamber of Mazarbul by Orcs. The Fellowship fled through a side door, but when Gandalf, who was also a Maia, tried to place a ""shutting spell"" on the door to block the pursuit behind them, the Balrog entered the chamber on the other side and cast a counterspell. Gandalf spoke a word of command to stay the door, but the door shattered and the chamber collapsed.
The company fled with Gandalf, but the Orcs and the Balrog, taking a different route, caught up with them at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. At the Bridge, Legolas instantly recognized it as a Balrog, and Gimli recognized it as Durin's Bane. Gandalf, the only one capable of battling it, then commanded the rest of the Fellowship to flee across the bridge, where he then stood, blocking the Balrog's way. The demon's flames then seemed to die, but its shadow increased before attacking with its flaming sword, which melted into red-hot liquid metal when it met Gandalf's own sword, Glamdring. The Balrog then leapt onto the bridge, brandishing its whip, and in response Gandalf smote the Bridge before him with his staff. The staff broke asunder, a blinding sheet of white flame springing up, and the bridge cracked at the feet of the Balrog, who fell forward into the abyss. But as the Balrog fell, it lashed out with its whip, catching Gandalf and dragging him over the edge and into the darkness below.[1]

After a long fall, the two crashed into a great subterranean lake, which Gandalf later said was as cold as the tide of death and almost froze his heart. The water quenched the Balrog's fire, reducing it to ""a thing of slime, stronger than a strangling snake"". Despite this relatively weak state, Durin's Bane renewed its attack on the wizard, and the two fought in the water, with the Balrog clutching at Gandalf to strangle him, and Gandalf hewing the Balrog with his sword, until finally the Balrog fled into ancient tunnels delved by nameless things. There, Gandalf pursued the creature up the Endless Stair and onto Durin's Tower, where Gandalf finally prevailed in the Battle of the Peak and slew the Balrog, casting it down from the peak of Zirakzigil and sending it crashing onto the mountain side.

The ultimate fate of Durin's Bane is not known, as only its physical form died, as with all Maiar when they were ""killed,"" but what happened to the spirit of the Balrog was not revealed. It is also unknown if it was the last of its kind, or if there were other Balrogs who managed to escape the War of Wrath and remained hidden in long forgotten places.[2]",

""Their task was to circumvent Sauron: to bring help to the few tribes of Men that had rebelled from Melkor-worship, to stir up rebellion... and after his first fall to search out his hiding and to cause dissension and disarray among the dark East... They must have had very great influence on the history of the Second Age and Third Age in weakening and disarraying the forces of the East... who both in the Second Age and Third Age otherwise have... outnumbered the West.""
—J.R.R. Tolkien
Alatar by Tom Cross.
Alatar was originally a Maia of Oromë the Huntsman. Other servants of Oromë included Pallando, a friend of Alatar, whom he later chose to journey with him. At some point in the Second Age, around the forging of the Rings of Power, Alatar and Pallando were chosen to become the first of the Istari and were sent to the east of Middle-earth to stir up rebellion against Sauron and assist the few tribes of Men who had refused to worship Morgoth in the First Age.[2]
Third Age[]
""I think that they went as emissaries to distant regions, east and south... Missionaries to enemy occupied lands as it were. What success they had I do not know; but I fear that they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; and I suspect they were founders or beginners of secret cults and ""magic"" traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron.""
—J.R.R. Tolkien
During the Third Age, the Valar selected Alatar to be one of the five Maiar to travel from the Undying Lands to Middle-earth and serve as wizards. Alatar, Curumo (Saruman the White), and Olórin (Gandalf) were assigned the objective of encouraging the peoples of Middle-earth to oppose Sauron. However, two more joined the original three, making them five. Aiwendil (Radagast) was chosen by Yavanna to travel with Curumo, and Alatar took Pallando as a companion. Upon arrival in Middle-earth, Alatar and Pallando were dressed in robes of sea-blue. Due to this, they were called the Blue Wizards (or Ithryn Luin in Sindarin). Along with Saruman, they traveled east in an attempt to help free the Haradrim and Easterlings from Sauron's service. Later, Saruman returned to the west alone. Alatar and Pallando were never seen again, and their fates remain untold.[3][4]",
739,Before the creation of Arda,,Male,,,Pallando,Ainur,,,,"Before he came to Middle-earth, Pallando was a Maia of Oromë the Huntsman. He was taken to Middle-earth at the bidding of Alatar, another Istar who took him as a friend.

Pallando and Alatar (known as the Blue Wizards for their sea-blue robes) traveled to the east of Middle-earth with Curumo (Saruman the White) to aid some men and subdue others, primarily the Easterlings and Southrons who worshiped Sauron, and whose numbers were steadily increasing. Saruman later returned to the West, but Pallando with Alatar stayed behind.
Other than this, not much is positively known about Pallando, but it is thought that he most likely failed his mission. However, in Tolkien's later years he provided an alternate name for the wizard, ""Rómestámo,"" meaning ""helper of the East"".

740,"Before the creation of ,Arda",Immortal,Female,,,Arien,Ainur,,,"Arien was a Maia-maiden, who first served Vána the ""Ever-young"" before she was charged to sail the vessel of the Sun. Arien was originally a spirit of fire whom Melkor was unable to deceive, or draw to his service. Her eyes were said to be too bright for even the Eldar to look upon. In the Years of the Trees, Arien tended to the golden flower gardens of Vána, watering the flowers with bright dews collected from the great, golden tree Laurelin. Later, the Valar chose Arien to carry the new vessel of the Sun because she was the only one who could courageously bear the heats of Laurelin, and was unhurt by it.[1] While in Valinor, Arien took a physical form similar to that of the Valar; but when she left Valinor, she forsook her raiment and became a ""naked flame of fire, terrible in the fullness of her splendour"".[2]
Arien holding the sun.
Later on, when the great Two Trees of Valinor were destroyed by Morgoth  and Ungoliant, the golden tree Laurelin managed to produce one last golden fruit before it died away. Subsequently Aulë, the ""Greatest Craftsman of Arda"", then created a vessel to hold the last golden fruit of Laurelin. However, the Maia Tilion, chosen to steer the vessel of the Moon, had traversed seven times before the vessel of the Sun was ready. So after the vessel for the Sun, named Anar the Fire-golden was ready at last, Arien carried it up into the Heavens, giving light to the World. Hence, Anar rose in glory and the first dawn of the Sun was like a great fire glowing upon the towers of the Pelóri mountains in Aman. And the clouds of Middle-earth were kindled, and many waterfalls were heard. At this, Morgoth was dismayed, and he descended to the lowest pits of Angband, withdrawing his servants as well. Thence, Morgoth sent forth great reeks and darkness of clouds to hide his own land from the new light of the Sun. Morgoth feared Arien greatly, and dared not come close to her.[2] It was said that Arien easily burned away the dark powers, but Tilion was waylaid and hard-pressed to hold his own, but still managed to pull through.[2]
It has been told that Arien was more powerful than Tilion, who was drawn to Arien and occasionally followed her through the night sky but when catching up to her, the Island of the Moon became burned and blackened by Arien's heat when in close proximity to her. Moreover, the Valar stored the great radiance of the Sun in many vessels, vats, and pools to use for their comfort in times of darkness.[1] As Arien was the ""Guardian of the Sun"", she was one of the most loved of the Maiar by mortal Men, as her first journey across the sky was the signal of the Awakening of Men.[2]",
741,"Before the creation of ,Arda",Immortal,Female,,,Uinen,,,Ossë,"Before the Sun and the Moon[]
Uinen loved all creatures that lived in the saltwater streams of the world and the weeds that grew in them. Her love calmed the violent tidal waves and storms created by Ossë her husband by keeping him in line and not going too far. Her hair spread throughout waters and lies on their surfaces. During the early days Arda, Ossë rebelled against his Lord Ulmo (Lord of All Waters) and served Melkor instead, being carried away by the false promises that Melkor gave to him. For a while, there rose great tumults in the sea that wrought great ruins to the lands. Because of this, and because of the prayers of Aulë who created those lands, Uinen helped bring Ossë back to the allegiance of their lord Ulmo by restraining her husband and bringing him before Ulmo. Following that, Ossë was pardoned and gave his allegiance back to the Valar.[1] To the Maiar Uinen and Ossë, Ulmo gave them the task of the governing of the waves and the movements of the Inner Seas. Ever afterwards, Uinen was the one who restrained Ossë's bouts of violence in the seas and on the coasts.[2]
Eventually, when the Teleri remained on the coast of the western seas, awaiting Ulmo to take them to Aman, Uinen and Ossë came among the Teleri and befriended them.[3] After the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, where Fëanor and his host of exiled Ñoldor attacked the Teleri and stole their ships, Uinen wept for the Telerin mariners who had been wickedly slain and tossed into the sea. The sea also rose in great wrath against the Ñoldorin slayers, so that many of the stolen Telerin ships were wrecked and the Ñoldor in them were drowned.[4]
When the Hiding of Valinor took place, Ossë raised the enchanted Isles. Then next, Uinen enchanted those who ever managed to reach the Isles by weaving them in her hair before Irmo (Master of Dreams & Desires) put them to age-long sleep.[5]
Second Age[]
In the Second Age, the mariners of Númenór would cry to Uinen for help, because she was the only one capable of calming Ossë who loved to create tumults in the seas. And the Númenóreans lived under her protection while their respect for the Valar endured. Therefore, the Númenóreans held the Maia Uinen in reverence as equal to the Valar.[1]",

Upon his return, he convinced many of his people to follow him back to that country. On the Elves' Great Journey to the West, the Teleri lingered behind and did not arrive at the coast until later, after the departure of the moving island of Tol Eressëa. Thus, they stayed in Beleriand for many years until Tol Eressëa was brought back to ferry them, by which time many of the Teleri had grown to love Beleriand and decided to stay there. Elwë was among them, having encountered Melian the Maia in the woods of Nan Elmoth and fallen deeply in love with her. Afterwards, he disappeared for many years causing many of his people to linger in Middle-earth to search for him.[4]
Rule of Doriath[]
For centuries, Elwë remained lost until he reemerged as a respected lord and many of his people joined him in the forest of Doriath, in Beleriand. Now known as Elu Thingol, he and Melian became king and queen of the Teleri that remained in Beleriand. This people became known as the Sindar. He founded a realm in a large forested area in Beleriand first known as Eglador (Land of the Forsaken). During these early days under the stars, Thingol and Melian had a daughter, Lúthien, who was said to be the fairest woman ever to have lived.
As Lord of Beleriand, Thingol welcomed his long lost kin, now known as the Laiquendi or Green-elves, into vast lands in Ossiriand. He was also the first Elf to make contact and alliances with the Dwarves of Belegost, who helped delve the caves of Menegroth, which became the capital of Thingol's kingdom. When the Dwarves first became aware of unfamiliar savage creatures coming out of the North, Thingol was the first to learn, and, possessing no heavy weapons of war, he once again asked the Dwarves for their aid. They forged for him necessary weapons and armour, for what would be the onset of war against Melkor.[5]

Quest for the Silmaril[]

When Melkor returned to Middle-earth, he sought once again to master it and its peoples, and declared war on them. He sent great hosts of Orcs into Beleriand, starting what became known as the First Battle of Beleriand. In this battle, Thingol led his people to victory against the Orcs, driving them out of his kingdom and most of Beleriand. Afterwards, Melian set the Girdle around his kingdom, which was thence named Doriath; no one could now enter the realm without Thingol's permission. When the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth, he gave them leave to dwell in the north part and dealt only with the House of Finarfin as they were kin through his brother Olwë. When he learned of the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, he was outraged and wanted nothing to do with most of the Ñoldor and their war and even outlawed the use of Quenya in his kingdom.[6]
Thingol was drawn into the war with Morgoth and the deadly Oath of Fëanor when after the Dagor Bragollach, Lúthien fell in love with a man named Beren. Thingol did not wish for the two to be wedded to each other, as he valued his daughter very highly and disliked the race of Men. As a bride-price he asked for a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth, thinking there was no way that Beren could fulfil this demand. Thus, Thingol was drawn into the quarrels over the great jewels and ultimately the doom of Fëanor.[7]
Death[]
It was this bride-price that doomed Thingol. After Húrin brought the treasures of Nargothrond to Doriath, Thingol summoned Dwarves of Belegost to Menegroth and invited them to work the treasure into jewelry. The finest of these pieces was the Nauglamír.
The Nauglamír was the second-greatest treasure of Doriath, prized above all but Beren and Lúthien's Silmaril. After the smiths of Belegost finished their work on the Nauglamír, Thingol requested that the Dwarves of Nogrod set the Silmaril in it. The Nauglamír, now bearing the Silmaril was held to be the fairest object in Arda.
Enthralled by and covetous of the Silmaril, the Dwarves demanded the necklace, insisting that as a dwarven work it belonged to them. Thingol was unwilling to surrender the treasure and replied with an impertinent answer. In their anger, the Dwarves attempted to slay him. After a long battle between Dwarves and Elves inside the city, the Dwarves were expelled. Two escaped to Nogrod and there told a false story of the conflict to their people, convincing them to march westward and do battle in the Thousand Caves. Later, with the help of certain treacherous Elves also possessed of the cursed treasure, Dwarves regained entrance past the Girdle. Thingol was lured out on a hunt with a small company of arms; he was ambushed by Dwarves in the woods, and was slain, allowing Menegroth to be taken and plundered. The Dwarves could not seize nor harm Melian, and she departed to seek Beren and Lúthien.[8]
Thingol's heir was Dior Eluchil, the son of Beren and Lúthien.[9]

747,FA 503,Still Alive,Male,Golden,,Eärendil,Half-elven,,Elwing,"Eärendil was the Half-elf son of Tuor and Princess Idril, daughter of Turgon. He was born in FA 503 and was raised in Gondolin. At the age of seven, he and his parents escaped the Sack of Gondolin, living afterwards in Arvernien by the mouth of Sirion.[3][5] The survivors of Gondolin and Doriath mingled at the Havens of Sirion. In FA 525,[2] Eärendil wedded Elwing, daughter of King Dior. Two years later, Elros and Elrond were born to them, and Eärendil began his voyage in search of Tuor and Idril, who had earlier departed over the Sea. With the aid of Círdan the Shipwright, Eärendil built a ship for this purpose, Vingilótë.[6]

At this time, Elwing had in her possession the Silmaril that Beren had once wrested from Morgoth. News of this came to the remaining Sons of Fëanor, and they attacked the people living in Arvernien, slaying most of them. Círdan and Gil-galad sent ships to their aid, but were too late. But Elwing, to avoid capture, threw herself with the Silmaril into the Sea, leaving her young sons behind.[6]
Hearing of the tragedy of Arvernien, Eärendil then sought after Valinor, and he and Elwing found their way there at last. Eärendil thus became the first of all mortals to set foot in Valinor. Eärendil then went before the Valar, and asked them for aid that would help the Men and Elves in Middle-earth fight against Morgoth; and the Valar accepted his plea.[6]
Eärendil slays Ancalagon, by Ted Nasmith
Because Eärendil had undertaken this errand on behalf of Men and Elves, and not for his own sake, Manwë forbore to deal out the punishment of death that was due; and because both Eärendil and Elwing were descended from a union of Elves and Men, Manwë granted to them and their sons the gift to choose to which race they would be joined (a gift that was further passed to the children of Elrond, who became known as the Half-elves). Elwing chose to be one of the Elves. Eärendil would have rather been one of the Men; however, for the sake of his wife, he chose to be one of the Elves.[6]
The Valar, having listened to Eärendil's plea, went with a mighty host to Middle-earth during the War of Wrath, overthrew Morgoth, and bound him. Eärendil took part in the battle, riding on Vingilot beside Thorondor and the Eagles. It was his blow that slew Ancalagon the Black, the greatest of Morgoth's winged dragons; and his dead body fell on Thangorodrim, the event which, along with the sheer devastation caused by the War of Wrath, led to the ruin of Beleriand.[6] Eärendil's fate was to eternally traverse the Great Ocean with the Silmaril that Beren and Lúthien had wrested from Morgoth and guard the Sun and Moon.
In the Second Prophecy of Mandos, it is told that Eärendil will return from the sky for the love of the Sun and Moon that Melkor would blot out, and fight in the Dagor Dagorath.",
748,"Late ,Third Age","Presumably sometime after ,TA 3019",Male,,,Harry Goatleaf,Men,,,,"Harry Goatleaf lived with[2] his brother Ned[2] in a small, dark gray house close to the West-gate of Bree.[3] He worked as a Gate-keeper stationed at a lodge next to the western gate, which was located on the great hedge surrounding the township of Bree.[1] On September 23 in the year 3018, Strider observed a Nazgûl having a conversation with Goatleaf before leaving him white and shaking.[4]
On September 29, Goatleaf encountered the Hobbits Frodo Baggins, Meriadoc Brandybuck, Peregrin Took, and Samwise Gamgee when they arrived at Bree. Goatleaf got a lantern and questioned them gruffly about their intentions, silently observing that they came from the Shire before letting them in. Before wishing them good night, he warned them that there would be more folk besides him at The Prancing Pony who would ask them questions.[1]
When Strider advised the four Hobbits to be more careful as the Nazgûl were seen passing the Greenway the previous Monday, Frodo realized that he should have known this from the way Goatleaf spoke to them. Later, when Strider predicted that something may happen that night before they leave Bree, he mentioned that Goatleaf may be a spy for the Nazgûl, noting the conversation he had overheard the previous Monday.[4]
Before the end of 3018, the Bree-men kicked the Ruffians among the Southerners out of Bree. Early in the New Year of 3019 however, the town was attacked in the night by the very same Ruffians. During the battle, Goatleaf fought on the side of the Ruffians along with Bill Ferny. After the battle, Goatleaf left Bree alongside the other Ruffians, hiding out in either the Chetwood beyond Archet, or in the wilds north of Bree. Later, it was believed by Barliman Butterbur that Goatleaf and Ferny were the ones who let the Ruffians in on the night of the battle.[5] It is likely that Goatleaf's position as a Gate-keeper was presumably later taken by another Gate-keeper."
