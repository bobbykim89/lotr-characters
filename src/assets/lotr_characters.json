Thus, Adanel was the great-grandmother of Beren, son of Emeldir, her granddaughter.\nThe Wise of the people of Marach were the only Men to preserve the tale of their original sin, when, soon after their awakening, the Men chose to worship Melkor instead of Eru. Adanel told this tale (called the Tale of Adanel in Morgoth's Ring) to Andreth of the House of B\u00ebor.\nAndreth was a very distant niece of Adanel's husband Belemir through the line of Baran, the eldest son of B\u00ebor, and Belemir through the line of his grandfather Belen, who was the youngest son of B\u00ebor. In addition, Andreth's nephew Barahir married Adanel's granddaughter Emeldir.[2]",

He served King Ondoher of Gondor as a general during the Wars of the Wainriders in the year 1944.[3]\nAdrahil was descended from a N\u00famen\u00f3rean noble house that settled in Belfalas in the Second Age.[4] Because of this, it is assumed he was an ancestor of Imraz\u00f4r, Galador and the Princes of Dol Amroth.[5]\nWhen King Ondoher led his army to face the Wainriders who threatened Gondor, Adrahil commanded the army's left wing. The soldiers of the right wing were under the command of the King's nephew Minohtar, while the centre was commanded by the king himself and his heir Artamir.\nOndoher's enterprise came to a devastating end: he was surprised by the Wainriders near the Black Gate, and his forces were overwhelmed. Adrahil's soldiers, however, were shielded from the attack and survived it. Ondoher and Artamir had both been killed, and Minohtar took charge, sending orders to Adrahil to withdraw with both his own command of the left wing and those at the rear of the right wing who had not yet been engaged.\nAdrahil withdrew south into Ithilien to form a defensive line from Cair Andros to the Ephel D\u00faath. With these forces, he was to cover the approaches to Minas Anor. Adrahil at once messaged E\u00e4rnil to inform him of the disaster and of the position of the retreating Northern Army.\nAdrahil's fate is uncertain; the Wainriders overwhelmed Minohtar's rearguard defence, but whether they penetrated to Adrahil's position is unknown. If he survived the initial assault, it seems likely that Adrahil would have joined with E\u00e4rnil in his counter-attack, seeing the ultimate defeat of the Wainriders at the Battle of the Camp.[6]",

As a covert leader of the Faithful in N\u00famenor, Amandil supported the old traditions of friendship with the Elves and reverence for the Valar, while Pharaz\u00f4n followed the contrary way of the King's Men and his own will. He deprived the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb of their lordship due to their support of the old King Tar-Palantir and commanded Amandil to dwell in R\u00f3menna. He took And\u00fani\u00eb and made it the chief harbour of his ships but did not remove Amandil from his council or otherwise harm him.\nIn SA 3261, Pharaz\u00f4n brought Sauron (who was disguised) to N\u00famenor and, over the years, was deceived by Sauron's lies.\nEventually sensing the impending doom of N\u00famenor, Amandil urged his son Elendil not to interfere in the imminent war but to expect and prepare for a forced departure from the island. He himself decided to set sail for Valinor to plead with the Valar for forgiveness and mercy for the N\u00famen\u00f3rean people, since at least a few had remained faithful.\nHe departed into the West either in SA 3310[1] or SA 3316,[1] just before the Great Armament was ready to launch, in an attempt to reach Valinor and save N\u00famenor. He set sail in a small ship with three servants dear to him (though no names are given for them) at night from R\u00f3menna, steering east as if his goal was to reach Middle-earth, but soon he turned and journeyed into the west. He never returned and was not heard from again.\nWhether Amandil's voyage was successful is untold, but soon after the destruction of N\u00famenor, a great wave carried Elendil's ships safely to Middle-earth, suggesting that Amandil's pleas had indeed been answered.[2]",

Amlaith's realm was reduced to the lands west of the River Baranduin and the Weather Hills, a region that came to be known as Arthedain. The other lands of Arnor were divided between Amlaith's brothers, creating the new kingdoms of Rhudaur to the east and Cardolan to the south.[1]\nWhatever the cause of the dissension between Amlaith and his brothers, the fact of his direct descent from Isildur was never in question.

Nerdanel initially named both twins Ambarussa and, when F\u00ebanor begged that their names should be different, she then provided Umbarto, though not to any twin specifically. Either disturbed by such an ominous name, or because he misheard her, F\u00ebanor changed it to Ambarto and gave it as the mother-name to Telufinw\u00eb, the younger twin.[4] He was deeply attached to his twin brother, and thus they were called \"Ambarussa\". They were nearly identical, being alike in both face and mood,[5] but the younger twin, Amrod, had a darker shade of red hair after childhood and was dearer to F\u00ebanor.[4]\nTwins were very rare among the Eldar, with Amras and Amrod being the only case recorded in the ancient histories until the later children in the line of Dior.[6] F\u00ebanor and his sons abode seldom in one place for long, but traveled far and wide upon the confines of Valinor, going even to the borders of the Dark and the cold shores of the Outer Sea, seeking the unknown. They were often guests in the halls of Aul\u00eb.[5]\nDuring the unrest of the \u00d1oldor and the strife between F\u00ebanor and his half-brother Fingolfin, F\u00ebanor was banished from Tirion and took up residence in Formenos; he was followed by his father, King Finw\u00eb, and his sons.[7] Along with Finw\u00eb, the sons of F\u00ebanor did not attend the high feast and were out riding when Formenos was attacked by Melkor and Ungoliant after the pair had killed the Two Trees. They attempted to return, but as they approached they were thrown from their horses. Once the cloud passed, they entered Formenos and found Finw\u00eb dead, the house ravaged, and the Silmarils stolen. They then sped to the Ring of Doom where Maedhros informed Manw\u00eb and, unknowingly, F\u00ebanor who kept himself hidden during the conversation. F\u00ebanor reacted by cursing both Melkor and the summons of Manw\u00eb, and then fleeing into the night; the sons of F\u00ebanor followed him, dismayed that he might slay himself.[8]\nF\u00ebanor and his sons soon returned to Tirion where, during a great speech by F\u00ebanor, they took a terrible oath of enmity and vengeance against all or any who dared to claim any right in the Silmarils, and led most of the \u00d1oldor into exile. As F\u00ebanor was preparing his host for Exile and to return to Middle-earth, Nerdanel approached him and begged that he should leave her youngest twin sons, or at least one of them.[4] F\u00ebanor rejected this, and stated that by deserting him (in not joining the Exile) she was deserting all their children as well.[4] Nerdanel retorted that he would not keep all of them, and at least one would never set foot on Middle-earth.[4]\nTo obtain the ships needed to pursue Morgoth into Middle-earth, F\u00ebanor's host seized them from the Falmari, killing many when they resisted, and thus came under the Doom of Mandos. After a long march northwards, the \u00d1oldor drew close to the Helcarax\u00eb, a land bridge deemed impassable, and the narrow strait between Aman and Middle-earth they intended to sail. With too few ships remaining to ferry all the \u00d1oldor at once, and the fear of treachery between their houses, F\u00ebanor and his sons stole away in them, abandoning the host of Fingolfin.[9]\nReturn to Middle-earth[]\nIn the morning after the Burning of the Ships at Losgar, Amras noticed the absence of his twin brother Amrod. He explained that Amrod was restless and did not sleep on the ground out of discomfort. He was the last to speak about this matter to F\u00ebanor.[4]\nF\u00ebanor's host traveled north and encamped on the northern shore of Lake Mithrim where they were attacked unaware by a host of Morgoth. In the battle that followed, F\u00ebanor's forces were swiftly victorious, and pursued the routed orcs over the Mountains of Shadow into Ard-galen.[10]\nLater, Amras and his brothers rescued their father who died in an ambush after Dagor-nuin-Giliath.[11] After F\u00ebanor's death, he settled the wide plains of East Beleriand between the rivers Celon and Little Gelion where few folk dwelt, and took it as his realm and hunting-ground. He became renown as a great hunter of the woods, though not more than Celegorm.[5] Amras had little direct involvement with the Siege of Angband,[12][13] but he was present at each kinslaying. If his brothers needed aid or shelter, he supported them. Amras died during the attack made by the Sons of F\u00ebanor on the Havens of Sirion in 538.[14]",

        "biography": "Third Age[]\nWhen Amroth's father, Amd\u00edr, was killed in the Battle of Dagorlad in SA 3434, Amroth became King of Lothl\u00f3rien. He would be the last of the ruling Sindar over L\u00f3rien.\nAmroth and Nimrodel[]\nAmroth's beloved, the elf-maiden Nimrodel, resented that Elves from Beleriand were being admitted into Lothl\u00f3rien due to Morgoth's aggression against that place. She believed that these foreign Elves brought wars and destroyed the peace that Lothl\u00f3rien's inhabitants had once enjoyed. When a Balrog was awakened in Moria by the delvings of the Dwarves and they fled north to the Lonely Mountain, many of the Elves living on the west side of L\u00f3rien moved inward, and the Galadhrim tightened their guard. Nimrodel, living on the west side of the forest by the stream that afterward bore her name, preferring not to mix with the Galadhrim who she deemed invaders of the golden wood, instead fled to Fangorn Forest in TA 1981 (Third Age). Amroth followed her to the forest, which was much closer to Lothl\u00f3rien than it later became. Upon attempting to enter the forest, Nimrodel was halted and badly frightened by the movements and murmurings of the Black Huorns who barred her entrance. She lingered on the edge of the forest, unsure of what to do. Amroth found her there a day later.\nThere, Amroth and Nimrodel spoke long and earnestly with one another, Amroth begging for her favor. Eventually, the Elf-Maiden promised that she would marry Amroth only if he brought her to a peaceful land.\nAmroth vowed that he would leave the Elves of Lothl\u00f3rien, even if a time came when they needed him most. However, none of Middle-earth was at peace and Amroth believed that the Elves would never enjoy peace again. He suggested that he and Nimrodel should travel across the Sundering Seas to the Undying Lands.\nAmroth knew that the Sindarin Elves had come to the Bay of Belfalas, a haven south of Lothl\u00f3rien, long ago. Although the majority of those Elves had left Middle-earth and sailed to the Undying Lands, Amroth was aware that some of their kind still built ships and offered passage to any of the other Elves wishing to leave Middle-earth. After Amroth made the necessary arrangements, he and Nimrodel left Lothl\u00f3rien.\nHowever, they somehow became separated on their journey. Amroth looked for Nimrodel, but his search was unsuccessful so he continued south towards the Sundering Seas.\nFate[]\nAt the havens on the Bay of Belfalas, Amroth found that the few remaining Sindarin Elves who remained in Middle-earth were preparing to leave aboard the only seaworthy ship that they had. Although they welcomed Amroth aboard, they were unwilling to wait for Nimrodel. They hoped that she was in Gondor and that she had not attempted to cross the White Mountains, where many unfriendly Men lived.\nThe summer was almost over and it would soon be autumn, which was expected to bring dangerously strong winds. However, the Elves saw that Amroth was extremely upset. They had removed all their possessions from their houses on the shore, so they waited with Amroth on their ship for many weeks. Summer passed and autumn came, but Nimrodel still did not arrive.\nOne night, one of the fiercest storms in the recorded history of Gondor came from the Northern Waste, swept through Eriador and caused an enormous amount of destruction to Gondor. Many of the ships that the Men of Gondor had built were swept away from the coast and sank. The wind broke the light Elven-ship from its moorings and hurled the vessel far from the Bay of Belfalas, driving it towards the coasts of Umbar.\nAt dawn of the following morning, the storm dissipated. However, when Amroth awoke, he saw that the ship was already far from its port. Full of despair, Amroth screamed Nimrodel's name, threw himself into the water below and drowned.\nThe ship was never seen again in Middle-earth, although it is likely that the vessel left the Circles of the World and eventually reached Tol Eress\u00eba, an island that the Eldar used to enable them to complete the Great Journey.\nNeither Elves nor Men ever saw Amroth or Nimrodel again, but there were many legends concerning Nimrodel's fate.\nLegacy[]\nNImrodel shared her name with a stream where she once lived, that indirectly flowed into the Bay of Belfalas. According to Elven legend, Amroth's voice continued to emanate from the Sea, and Nimrodel's voice often resonated from the stream of Nimrodel.[3][4]",

Being an archer, he then joined Gaurwaith, a band of outlaws that hunted the forests south of the River Taeglin, and was remembered as \"the grimmest among them\".\nWhen T\u00farin first appeared among the outlaws and slew one of their men, Andr\u00f3g quickly perceived both T\u00farin's superiority and the Curse of Morgoth that followed him. Despite this, he esteemed T\u00farin and became one of his closest followers. Later, T\u00farin spared Andr\u00f3g despite his participation in Forweg's attempt to trap Larnach's daughter, and Andr\u00f3g supported him in becoming the leader of the band. After Beleg was captured by the outlaws, Andr\u00f3g urged them to kill him, coveting Beleg's bow, Belthronding, and showed no favor to the Elf even after his release by T\u00farin.\nAndr\u00f3g was foremost in the attempt to capture the Petty-dwarves, seizing M\u00eem and shooting arrows at his sons. Once again, he wished to slay M\u00eem immediately, despising all Dwarves, and doubted his gift of Amon R\u00fbdh. Andr\u00f3g was cursed by M\u00eem when it became known that his arrow slew Kh\u00eem:\n\n\"He that loosed the shaft shall break his bow and his arrows and lay them at my son's feet; and he shall never take arrow nor bear bow again. If he does, he shall die by it.\"\n\u2014M\u00eem\nAndr\u00f3g obeyed, fearing the Dwarf's curse, but prophesied in reply that M\u00eem would \"lack a bow at need ere his end\". Some time afterward, Andr\u00f3g took up his bow and arrows again and was wounded by a poisoned shaft. He was healed by Beleg at T\u00farin's bidding but continued to mistrust the Elf. M\u00eem's curse, however, was not put to rest. In fact, this act made M\u00eem even angrier, as all Petty-dwarves hated Elves with a passion.\nDuring the Sack of Amon R\u00fbdh, Andr\u00f3g led some of the band to the top of the hill by a secret stair he had discovered some time before. There, he fought more valiantly than any but fell mortally wounded by an arrow. His son, Andv\u00edr, however, survived the battle.[1]\nThis page uses content from Wikipedia.

After the Noldor's return to Middle-earth, he fought under Fingolfin and Fingon at Dagor Aglareb, the Siege of Angband, the Battle of the Firth of Drengist, Dagor Bragollach, and the Second Assault on Hithlum.[citation needed]\nAfter the Union of Maedhros was formed in the year 468,[3] Annael led a small force of the Grey-elves of Mithrim to take part in the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad in the year 472[4]. Annael was the only survivor of from that company who returned to Mithrim. While R\u00edan was hosted by the Grey-elves at Lake Mithrim during the birth of her son Tuor, she asked them to foster him, as she wished to leave and search of her husband Huor. Annael explained to her how Huor had died, and she left the dwelling and went northwards to die on the Haudh-en-Ndengin. Thus, Annael became the foster-father of Tuor during his early years.[1]\nAs the years passed, in order to seek refuge from the Easterlings and the Orcs, Annael led his small group of people to Androth. In the year 488, when Tuor was sixteen, Annael had to prevent him from going to fight against the enemies of the House of Hador, foreseeing that Morgoth's power would not be defeated until Thangorodrim was overthrown, and that they had to escape south through the Annon-in-Gelydh, which was built long before by King Turgon's people. Tuor was much intrigued by the name of Turgon and wished to meet him, but Annael told him how well hidden Turgon's realm was. Despite having parted in secret from Androth, Annael's people were located and ambushed by a large force of Orcs and Easterlings under their chief Lorgan. The Elves were all scattered, and Tuor was captured and taken as a slave. However, Annael and many of his folk survived the attack and escaped Dor-l\u00f3min. Annael and his people eventually joined C\u00edrdan at the Havens of Sirion in the distant south of Beleriand.[1]\nWhile it is untold what Annael's fate was, it is likely that, if he survived the Third Kinslaying and the War of Wrath, he either heeded E\u00f6nw\u00eb's call and sailed to the Undying Lands, or he remained with C\u00edrdan in Lindon.[5] If he remained in Middle-earth, then he may have fought in the Siege of Eregion, the Siege of Lindon, the First Siege of Imladris, the Battle of the Gwathl\u00f3, the War of the Last Alliance, the Weather Hills skirmishes, the Fall of Fornost, and the Battle of Fornost. During the War of the Ring, he went to Lothl\u00f3rien to aid and he fought in the First Battle of L\u00f3rien, the Second Battle of L\u00f3rien, the Third Battle of L\u00f3rien, and the Destruction of Dol Guldur. After the defeat of Sauron, he sailed to Valinor in the Fourth Age.[citation needed]",

He and Isildur lived at the haven of R\u00f3menna on the east coast of the island of N\u00famenor. Their father was Elendil son of Amandil, the Lord of And\u00fani\u00eb.\nIn SA 3262, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n took Sauron captive and brought him to N\u00famenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken because he wanted to corrupt the N\u00famen\u00f3reans. He used their desire for power to convince them to renounce Eru and worship Morgoth. As Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave N\u00famenor. They filled nine ships (two for An\u00e1rion) with many of their prized possessions, including the palant\u00edri.[1]\nSauron's lies convinced Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n that he could achieve power in the Undying Lands. In SA 3319, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n set out with a great fleet intending to take the Undying Lands by force but when he set foot on the shore, Eru caused the Seas to open up. The fleet sank and N\u00famenor was destroyed by a great wave.[1]\nFounding of Gondor[]\nThe ships of the Faithful were spared, and a great wind from the west sent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north, whilst Isildur and An\u00e1rion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the south. Elendil established the Northern-kingdom of Arnor and his sons the Southern-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the King of both realms, but he dwelled in Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor to his sons.[2]\nAn\u00e1rion made his home in Minas Anor on the western side of the Anduin, while Isildur lived in Minas Ithil on the eastern side, Osgiliath was their joint capital. An\u00e1rion had one of the palant\u00edri, which he used to communicate with his brother and father.[1]\nWar of the Last Alliance[]\nWhen Sauron and the forces of Mordor attacked Gondor and captured Minas Ithil in SA 3429, Isildur and his family were forced to flee to Ann\u00faminas in Arnor. After the loss of Ithilien, Anarion gathered an army and defended Osgiliath from Sauron, driving the enemy out of Ithilien and returning Minas-Ithil the following year. In the meantime the Last Alliance of Elves and Men was formed and Sauron's forces were defeated in the Battle of Dagorlad. The army of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and laid siege to the Barad-d\u00fbr.

        "biography": "Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n was the son of Gimilkh\u00e2d, leader of the King's Men during the reign of Tar-Palantir of N\u00famenor. He grew into a man of great will, strength, and stature, and in early years was a good friend of his distant kin Amandil, future Lord of And\u00fani\u00eb and leader of the Faithful. However, he was raised deeply in the ways of the King's Men, a faction to soon become the Faithful's adversary.\nIn time, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n was a very proud man, gradually desiring wealth and glory. He grew restless in his homeland, and so went often abroad, leading like-minded N\u00famen\u00f3reans in wars against Men of Middle-earth's coasts whom N\u00famenor had begun to seek control of. In this he fared well on both land and sea, winning great respect as a captain and great wealth, wherefore his fame in N\u00famenor grew also.\nUpon the death of his uncle, Tar-Palantir, who had no son, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n decided to wed his daughter, M\u00edriel, against her will and against N\u00famen\u00f3rean law. As Tar-M\u00edriel was the rightful Ruling Queen of N\u00famenor, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n was able to usurp the throne. He gave to his wife the name Ar-Zimraphel, refusing to use the Elven speech, whilst persecuting the last vestiges of the Faithful.\nAs time passed, it came to his attention that Sauron, the Lord of Mordor, was expanding his power throughout Middle-earth and was being called the Lord of Men. Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, ever prideful, resolved to challenge him for lordship of the earth. In SA 3261, he marched upon Mordor with an army so powerful that Sauron's forces simply deserted him. But Sauron was cunning, and he feigned to be overawed at Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n's might. The king did not trust Sauron, and brought him back to N\u00famenor as a hostage. However, Sauron quickly took advantage of his situation to gain Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n's trust, and by way of careful flattery, lies and half-truths, he soon became the king's closest and most trusted advisor. He was able to corrupt Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, deceiving him to worship Morgoth (Sauron's former master) in the hope that he would be able to cheat mortality, though Sauron was well aware that this would not grant him immortality. Some results of Sauron's manipulations, deceptions and cunning were the erecting of a great Temple for Morgoth, intense persecution of the Faithful, and the chopping down of the White Tree of N\u00famenor. Soon, the king and his followers worshiped Morgoth openly and burned innocents at the altar of the temple as sacrificial offerings to appease the false god, unaware they were being lied to and deceived by Sauron.\nThen, as Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n felt the bite of old age upon him, Sauron was able to deceive him to attack Valinor and claim the right to immortality by force. He began the building of a huge fleet, the Great Armament, to attack Valinor in SA 3310; and for nine years, his men toiled on the western coasts of N\u00famenor in the making and training of a great host of war. In this way he became the most powerful tyrant in Arda since the days of Morgoth himself, though in truth Sauron ruled all from behind the throne. In fact, so great was the power of his fleet that it was said that they might have been able to overthrow the Valar themselves, had they reached Valinor.[3] Finally in SA 3319, he and his great force set sail for the west, breaking the Ban of the Valar and coming to the shores of the Undying Lands after thirty-nine days at sea. When he first gazed upon Taniquetil, shining white as snow yet as terrible as the might and supremacy of Eru Il\u00favatar himself, even he, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, the mighty King of Men and of the seas, became afraid and nearly turned back. Despite all that he saw, neither fear nor wisdom would prevail, for pride was the master of the king and so he was resolved to go onward. He led his troops onto land, passing through the Calacirya. Here he proclaimed the land his if no one would challenge him for it. Then, by nightfall, he led his men to the hill of T\u00fana and made camp there.\nThe Valar then laid down their guardianship of the world and called upon Eru, the One. By mid-morning, he sank Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n's fleet and all of N\u00famenor beneath the ocean, changing the shape of the world. Valinor was no longer connected to Middle-earth, and mortals could no longer find it. Afterwards, only Elves and a few remarkable exceptions could reach it, following the Straight Road into the far west. Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n and his mighty host who landed on Aman were buried by mounds of dirt, and remain in the Caves of the Forgotten until the last battle, or Dagor Dagorath. He and his great army's role in the end of days has not been made clear.\nAr-Pharaz\u00f4n at sea\nLegacy and successors[]\nAr-Pharaz\u00f4n's tyrannical rule and rebellious resolve to break the Ban of the Valar and make war upon the west led to the end of the royal N\u00famen\u00f3rean line and of N\u00famenor itself. Instead, the House of Elros was continued from the long line of the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb, begun through Elros' great-granddaughter Silmari\u00ebn and her son Valandil, the first Lord of And\u00fani\u00eb. As Amandil of And\u00fani\u00eb did not return from his venture into the west, his son Elendil became the founder of new kingdoms created in Middle-earth in exile. Elendil's two surviving sons, Isildur and An\u00e1rion followed him into exile and their descendants would rule as Kings for thousands of years. Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n was remembered by the surviving N\u00famen\u00f3rean lineage with a sort of grudging respect. Despite his errors, he was the first and last Man capable of beating and humiliating the powerful dark lord Sauron by himself. In remembrance to this feat, a great white pillar was erected in Umbar to the Golden King of N\u00famenor: a dark crystal globe, on a tall white column, which absorbed and radiated the sun's rays and glimmered in the night for everyone to see. The monument was destroyed by the Corsairs of Umbar after Sauron's return to Mordor in the late Third Age.[1][4][5][6]",

        "biography": "Early years\nAragorn as a toddler, portrayed by Luke Johnston in the fan film Born of Hope\nHe was Aragorn son of Arathorn, the nine and thirtieth heir in the right line from Isildur, and yet more like Elendil than any before him.\u2014The Silmarillion, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\nAragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur through the line of the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb to Elendil, High King of Arnor and Gondor. Like all of the kings before him, he was Elrond's kin through the House of Elros.  His ancestor Arvedui was wedded to F\u00edriel, descended from An\u00e1rion, who bore their son Aranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant of both Isildur and An\u00e1rion.\nWhen he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while pursuing Orcs. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond. At the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn was renamed \"Estel\" and was not told about his heritage until 2951.[1]\nYoung Aragorn with the shards of Narsil, by Anna Lee\nElrond revealed to \"Estel\" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, giving him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil, but withholding the Sceptre of Ann\u00faminas from Aragorn until he \"came of the right\" to possess the item. It was also around this time that Aragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of Lothl\u00f3rien where she had been visiting her grandmother Galadriel.[1]\nAragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of the D\u00fanedain and left the comforts of Rivendell for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his people, the Rangers of the North, whose kingdom had been destroyed through division and the Angmar Wars centuries before.[1]\nAragorn met Gandalf the Grey in 2956 and they became close friends. Heeding Gandalf's advice, Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small land known as the Shire inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian Hobbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the Shire's borders as Strider.\nFrom TA 2957 to TA 2980, Aragorn undertook great journeys, serving in the armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor. Many of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the growing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he earned priceless experience which he would later put to use in the War of the Ring. Aragorn served these lords in disguise and his name in Gondor and Rohan during that time was Thorongil (\"Eagle of the Star\"). With a small squadron of ships from Gondor, he led an assault on the long-standing City of the Corsairs in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' ships and personally overthrowing the Captain of the Haven during a battle upon the quays. After the victory at Umbar, \"Thorongil\" left Gondor and, to the dismay of his men, went east.[2]\nLater in 2980, he visited Lothl\u00f3rien, and there once again met Arwen. He gave her the heirloom of his House, the Ring of Barahir, and, on the hill of Cerin Amroth, Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage, renouncing her Elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of Il\u00favatar: Death.[1]\nElrond withheld from Aragorn permission to marry his daughter until such a time as his foster son should be king of \"both\" Gondor and Arnor. As both Elrond and Aragorn knew, to marry a mortal, Arwen would be required to choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless Elrond of his daughter while the world lasted. Elrond was also concerned for Arwen's own happiness, fearing that in the end she might find death (her own and that of her beloved) too difficult to bear.[1]\nBefore the events of The Lord of the Rings properly take place, Aragorn traveled widely through Middle-earth, entering the Dwarven mines of Moria via the East-gate of Moria but exiting the same way. He also journeyed to Harad, where (in his own words) \"the stars are strange\". Tolkien indicated that these travels occurred after TA 2980, but does not indicate what happened during Aragorn's visits.\nIn TA 3009, Gandalf grew suspicious of the origin of the Ring belonging to the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, which later turned out to be the One Ring, the key to the Dark Lord Sauron's power. Setting a guard of Rangers on the Shire, Aragorn went at Gandalf's request into Rhovanion in search of Gollum, who had once possessed the Ring. He caught the creature in the Dead Marshes near Mordor, and brought him as a captive to Thranduil's Halls in Mirkwood, where Gandalf questioned him.[3] Gollum, however, escaped some time later with the aid of Sauron's Orcs.\nStrider sitting in The Prancing Pony, by Giovani Bellofatto\nWar of the Ring\nWhat his right name is I've never heard: but he's known round here as Strider.\u2014Barliman Butterbur, speaking of Aragorn in The Fellowship of the Ring, \"At the Sign of the Prancing Pony\"\nEscorting the hobbits\nAragorn returned with Gandalf in the spring of TA 3018, and then went away on his own journey, and was not able to help when Gandalf discovered the Nazg\u00fbl were seeking for Frodo and the Ring in the Shire. After Frodo left Hobbiton, Gildor Inglorion informed Aragorn that the Nine were looking for him and Gandalf was missing. Aragorn continued to watch the Great East Road until Tom Bombadil and the four hobbits came from the Barrow-downs. Following them to Bree, he met Frodo at the Inn of the Prancing Pony under the name \"Strider,\" as the Men of Bree called him.[4] Though originally the hobbits were suspicious of him, Barliman Butterbur brought a letter from Gandalf that made them trust him.[5] Aragorn was aged 87 at that time, nearing the prime of life for one of royal N\u00famen\u00f3rean descent.\nAfter the raid on Bree, Aragorn led the Hobbits out of Bree-land and through the Midgewater Marshes. While there, he saw Gandalf's battle with the Nazg\u00fbl on Weathertop from a distance. When they themselves came to Weathertop, they discovered five of the Nazg\u00fbl had followed them, and during the later attack he fought off the Ringwraiths. After attempting to heal Frodo with athelas, he led them across the Lone-lands towards the Trollshaws.[6] They met with the Elf-lord Glorfindel who led them to the Ford of Bruinen. When the Nazg\u00fbl caught up with them and Elrond released a flood, Aragorn and the Hobbits kindled fire and flushed out those Nazg\u00fbl that had remained on the western bank. He then accompanied Frodo to Rivendell.[7]\nAragorn and Arwen in woods near Rivendell, by Stephen Hickman\nDuring the feast of victory, Aragorn was gathering news from Elladan and Elrohir, and later helped his friend Bilbo compose his Lay of E\u00e4rendil. During the Council of Elrond, he revealed himself to Boromir as the heir of Isildur and described his capture of Gollum. After Elrond decided that the Ring must be destroyed in Mordor, Frodo took the burden upon himself. There, Aragorn chose to join Frodo, thus forming the Fellowship of the Ring, tasked with accompanying Frodo in destroying the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Besides Aragorn, Gandalf, and Frodo, the company included Frodo's cousins Pippin and Merry, his best friend Samwise Gamgee, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Boromir of Gondor.[3]\nAll that is gold does not glitter,\nNot all those who wander are lost;\nThe old that is strong does not wither,\nDeep roots are not reached by the frost.\nFrom the ashes a fire shall be woken,\nA light from the shadows shall spring;\nRenewed shall be Blade that was Broken,\nThe crownless again shall be king.\n\u2014 Bilbo's poem about Aragorn[5]\nBefore the group set out, the shards of Narsil were re-forged, and the restored blade was named And\u00faril.\nAccompanying the Fellowship\nAragorn and Gandalf had been planning their journey to Mordor for weeks. He and Gandalf guided the Fellowship south along the line of the Misty Mountains. When they came to Hollin, Aragorn grew suspicious due to the lack of any sound he heard and spotted the Crebain who were spying out the land for Saruman. He then convinced Gandalf to try the pass over Caradhras. However, while they were still far down the mountain, they were caught in a freak storm brought on by Sauron, and were forced to retreat. Aragorn, together with Boromir, made a path through the snow for the Fellowship to escape.\nAragorn the Ranger in the wild, in the fan film The Hunt for Gollum\nAfter it was proposed to go through Moria, Aragorn reluctantly agreed to go and helped fight off the Wargs that attacked them during the night. Helping to rescue Frodo from the Watcher in the Water, once the company entered Moria, Aragorn remained at the back and noticed Gollum beginning to follow them. After they were attacked in the Chamber of Mazarbul, Aragorn fought off the attackers and killed the Orc-Chieftain, (or Cave-troll in the movies) that had seemingly killed Frodo. During Gandalf's battle with the Balrog on the Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm, Aragorn ran to his side and became the Fellowship's leader after Gandalf fell, presumed dead.[8] Aragorn then led the company to Lothl\u00f3rien, where he visited Cerin Amroth for the last time. At their parting, Lady Galadriel gave him the Elfstone.[9]\nAfter L\u00f3rien, Aragorn and the Fellowship sailed down the River Anduin to the Falls of Rauros. Aragorn attempted to catch Gollum several times. Though his original plan was to set out for Gondor and aid its people in the war, he felt responsible for Frodo after the loss of Gandalf and was conflicted about what path to take.[10]\nBreaking of the Fellowship\nFear not! he said. \"Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses of Isildur and Anarion, my sires of old. Under their shadow Elessar, the Elfstone son of Arathorn of the House of Valandil Isildur's son heir of Elendil, has naught to dread!\u2014 Aragorn proclaiming his lineage[10]\"\nAfter passing the Argonath, the Fellowship camped at Parth Galen. Frodo saw that Boromir had been driven mad by the influence of the One Ring, trying to take it. Frodo put the Ring on, rendering him invisible, and ran away from Boromir. Frodo climbed to the high seat on Amon Hen; from there he could see Sauron's eye looking for him. The Hobbit felt the eye but the Dark Lord was distracted by Gandalf the White.\nAragorn at Amon Hen in the film trilogy\nAt this same time, the others were attacked by Saruman's Uruk-hai and a battle ensued. During the ensuing battle, Boromir was killed defending Merry and Pippin, expressing his remorse privately to Aragorn for trying to take the Ring. After discovering that Frodo had left, Aragorn and the others decided that they would leave Frodo and Sam to rescue Merry and Pippin. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn put Boromir's body and war gear in one of the Elven boats as a funeral boat and tribute to Boromir for his bravery and courage. His body would be sent over the Falls of Rauros.[11]\nWhile Frodo continued his quest with Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli went to Rohan to free Merry and Pippin, who had been captured by the Uruk-hai in Saruman's service.\nThe Three Hunters\nAragorn ran from Parth Galen across the width of Rohan in just four days. As they approached Fangorn Forest, the \"Three Hunters\" Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli encountered \u00c9omer, who had recently pursued and routed an Orc-band in the area. From \u00c9omer, Aragorn learned that the Orcs who had kidnapped Merry and Pippin had been destroyed and that the Hobbits had not been found. Dejected, he led Legolas and Gimli to the site of the battle. Clues led Aragorn to believe that the Hobbits might still be alive, and he led the Three Hunters into Fangorn Forest.[12] They did not find the Hobbits, but they did find Gandalf the White, sent back to continue his struggle against Sauron. Gandalf told the Three Hunters that the Hobbits were safe with the Ents of Fangorn.[13]\nThe Three Hunters, by Ted Nasmith\nWhere now are the Dunedain, Elessar, Elessar?\nWhere do thy kinsfolk wander afar?\nNear is the hour when the lost should come forth,\nAnd the Grey Company ride from the North.\nBut dark is the path appointed to thee:\nThe Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea.\n- Galadriel's message to Aragorn[13]\nThe Battle of Hornburg\nTogether, Gandalf and the Three Hunters travelled to Edoras, where Gandalf freed Th\u00e9oden from Saruman's enchantment and helped him organize the Rohirrim against Saruman.[14] He allied with Th\u00e9oden and joined the king's \u00c9ored, journeying to Helm's Deep.\nNight Battle on Helm's Deep, by Shin Lin\nAragorn fighting in the battle of helms deep\nAragorn, Legolas and Gimli then helped the people of Rohan in the Battle of the Hornburg, in which they conclusively defeated Saruman's army.[15] Afterward Aragorn went with Gandalf to Isengard, only to find it in ruins by the work of the Ents. Aragorn, being present with Gandalf, Th\u00e9oden, \u00c9omer, Legolas and Gimli, negotiated in a final parley with Saruman. Saruman attempted to bend Th\u00e9oden to his will, and at first the king was almost swayed, but mastering his will he refused to join with Saruman. Saruman also attempted to sway Gandalf, but failed in this also, and even so Gandalf offered his counterpart the opportunity for forgiveness. Saruman refused to repent out of pride and to avoid seeming a rebel to Sauron, and thus Gandalf broke Saruman's staff and banished him from the Order of Wizards and the White Council. After Saruman crawled away, Gr\u00edma Wormtongue threw the palant\u00edr of Orthanc at Gandalf as he and the others were leaving. He missed, however, unable to decide if he hated Saruman or Gandalf more, and thus ended the Battle of the Hornburg and the destruction of Isengard. After Pippin revealed himself to Sauron in the stone, Gandalf gave the palant\u00edr to Aragorn.[16]\nNot long after the Grey Company of Rangers arrived from the north, dispatched by Galadriel. With them rode Elladan and Elrohir and Halbarad, bearing a standard made for him by Arwen. When Aragorn returned to Helms Deep, he decided to draw Sauron out and used the palant\u00edr to show himself and And\u00faril to the Dark Lord, wrenching the Stone to his will after a long struggle with the Dark Lord. However, this led Sauron to swiftly send out the forces he had long prepared to attack Minas Tirith.\nReturn of the King\nAragorn with the Army of the Dead\nIn order to defend the city, Aragorn travelled the Paths of the Dead, and summoned the Dead Men of Dunharrow who owed allegiance to the Heir of Isildur. It had been prophesied by Isildur and Malbeth the Seer that the Dead would be summoned once more to pay their debt for betraying Gondor an age before. With their aid the Corsairs of Umbar were defeated at the Battle of Pelargir.[17]\nAragorn, a small force of Rangers, and a large contingent of men and soldiers from the southern regions then sailed up the Anduin to Minas Tirith. When they arrived at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Aragorn unfurled a standard that Arwen had made for him which showed both the White Tree of Gondor along with the jeweled crown and seven stars of the House of Elendil. With the help of the southern forces the armies of Gondor and Rohan rallied together and defeated Sauron's army.[18]\nThe Steward Denethor II declared that he would not bow to a descendant of Isildur (years before, he had seen \"Thorongil\" as a rival to his father's favor and soon discovered his true identity) and burned himself to death during the battle, despairing of final victory. Aragorn healed Faramir, Denethor's last heir, \u00c9owyn and Merry, who together slew the Witch-king as well as many others. This won him the immediate recognition of Faramir as rightful heir to the throne; his humility and self-sacrifice gained him the hearts of the inhabitants of Gondor's capital city. Aragorn's healing abilities, moreover, were a sign to the people of Gondor of the identity of their true king; as Ioreth said, \"The hands of the King are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known.\" The people hailed him as King that same evening.[19]\nAragorn Captain of the West\nDespite his immediate success and popularity, however, and despite his claim to the throne through raising the royal banner, Aragorn decided to lay aside his claim for the time being. He knew that if he aggressively promoted his claim, rival claimants or debates as to his legitimacy were not out of the question, and this could be a fatal distraction for Gondor at a time when the West needed to be united against Sauron. So, to avoid conflict, after he had healed people during the following nights of March 15\u201316, he left Minas Tirith and symbolically refused to enter it again until he was crowned King on May 1.\nCaptain of the West\nAragorn then led the Army of the West to Mordor as per the advice of Gandalf and Elrond, to divert Sauron's attention from Frodo and Sam. They marched over the Anduin river and came to Minas Morgul, and set fire to the fields there. Leaving a guard at the Cross-roads of the Fallen King, they began to march north along the North Road of Ithilien, and Aragorn won a skirmish against some Orcs and Easterlings that tried to ambush them. They then reached the desert before Mordor, and Aragorn allowed those who were afraid to depart to retake Cair Andros. The Army of the West then reached the Black Gate, and Aragorn along with Gandalf, \u00c9omer, Imrahil, Pippin, Legolas and Gimli rode up to it and called for Sauron to come forth. He then watched as the Mouth of Sauron revealed Sauron knew about Frodo and Sam, and saw Gandalf's rejection of Sauron's terms. The Host of the West was then encircled by Sauron's forces, a vast army of Orcs and Men. Aragorn then arranged the Army of the West defensively on two Slag-hills and the Battle of the Morannon began.\nAfter the destruction of the Ring and the defeat of Sauron, Aragorn freed the slaves of N\u00farn and gifted them the entire land in southern Mordor.\nAs King of Reunited Gondor and Arnor\nThen Faramir stood up and spoke in a clear voice: \u201cMen of Gondor, hear now the Steward of this Realm! Behold! One has come to claim the kingship again at last. Here is Aragorn, son of Arathorn, chieftain of the D\u00fanedain of Arnor, Captain of the Host of the West, bearer of the Star of the North, wielder of the Sword Reforged, victorious in battle, whose hands bring healing, the Elfstone, Elessar of the line of Valandil, Isildur's son, Elendil's son of N\u00famenor. Shall he be king and enter into the City and dwell there?\" And all the host and all the people cried yea with one voice.\u2014Faramir the Steward announces the coronation of King Elessar\nAragorn, son of Arathorn, King of Gondor\nUpon Sauron's defeat, Aragorn was crowned as King Elessar, a name given to him by Galadriel and adopted by the people of Gondor because of the Elfstone he wore. He became the twenty-sixth King of Arnor, thirty-fifth King of Gondor, and the first High King of the Reunited Kingdom, though it would be several years before his authority was firmly re-established in Arnor. His line was referred to as the House of Telcontar (Telcontar being Quenya for \"Strider\"). Aragorn married Arwen shortly afterwards, and ruled the Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor until 120 of the Fourth Age. His reign was marked by great harmony and prosperity within Gondor and Arnor, and by a great renewal of cooperation and communication among Men, Elves, and Dwarves, fostered by his vigorous rebuilding campaign following the war. Aragorn led the forces of the Reunited Kingdom on military campaigns against some Easterlings and Haradrim, re-establishing rule over all the territory that Gondor had lost in previous centuries.\nDuring his coronation, Aragorn spoke Elendil's Oath: \"Et E\u00e4rello Endorenna ut\u00falien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!\" (\"Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place, I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.\")[20]\n\nEnd of Reign and Death\nThen a great beauty was revealed in him, so that all who after came there looked on him in wonder; for they saw that the grace of his youth, and the valour of his manhood, and the wisdom and majesty of his age were blended together. And long there he lay, an image of the Kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.\u2014 Description of Aragorn's death.[1]\nAragorn's funeral\nWhen in the year 120 of the Fourth Age, King Elessar realised his days were at an end, he went to the House of the Kings in the Silent Street. He said farewell to his son Eldarion and his daughters and gave Eldarion his crown and sceptre. Arwen remained at Aragorn's side until he died. A year after Aragorn's death, Arwen died in Lothl\u00f3rien of a broken heart. Eldarion began his reign as the second King of the Reunited Kingdom after his father's death.[1]",

Most of the surviving people, including Aranarth, fled to Lindon, but King Arvedui went north to the Icebay of Forochel. Aranarth urged C\u00edrdan to send\u00a0ships to rescue Arvedui, but the ship never returned. It was later learned that the ship had sunk with Arvedui on board as well as the palant\u00edri of the north.[2]\nBy right, this made Aranarth now King of Arnor, but since the kingdom was lost he decided not to claim the title. Aranarth rode with the army of Gondor under E\u00e4rnur and saw the destruction of Angmar. Aranarth's people became known as the Rangers of the North and he was the first of their Chieftains who dwelt in the wilds of Eriador. In time, their origins were generally forgotten by the remaining people of Eriador.[2]\nWhile the Rangers defended Arnor from the remnants of Angmar's evil, the Wizard Gandalf went to Dol Guldur, and drove out Sauron the Necromancer. Thus began the period known as the Watchful Peace, a time where attacks by the enemy were few and far between.

Malbeth's prophecy included a choice for the D\u00fanedain: if they took the less hopeful path, Arvedui would not change his name and would remain the last king, leading to much sorrow and many lives lost until the D\u00fanedain were united again.\nFor some five hundred years, Arthedain had held off the constant attacks of the evil realm of Angmar. Araphant continued fighting off these attacks with failing strength.[3]\nDuring his time, the rulers of Arthedain and Gondor became aware that a force was conducting coordinated attacks on the exiles of N\u00famenor. Araphant therefore renewed contact with Gondor and forged an alliance with King Ondoher, leading to a marriage between Ondoher's daughter F\u00edriel and Araphant's son Arvedui. Four years later, King Ondoher died during an attack by the Wainriders, and Arvedui made a claim for the throne of Gondor by right of his blood connection to Isildur and his wife F\u00edriel, who by the laws of N\u00famenor should have become the Ruling Queen. This claim was denied by Gondor, and the kingship of Gondor passed to E\u00e4rnil II.\nAraphant died in TA 1964 after ruling for seventy-three years and was succeeded by his son Arvedui.[2]",

Nonetheless, he ruled a diminished and dwindling people; the wars of his youth had seen the Northern D\u00fanedain come close to destruction. Rhudaur was now ruled by Angmar, and the D\u00fanedain of Cardolan were all but extinct.\nDuring these wars many Stoors (Hobbits) fled from Eriador and returned to Wilderland, and became the river people of Sm\u00e9agol and D\u00e9agol.\nAraphor died in TA 1589 after ruling Arthedain for one hundred and eighty years, and was succeeded by his son, named for Araphor's heroic grandfather Argeleb, who ruled as Argeleb II.[2]",

We are also told that he attempted the recolonization of Cardolan, though this was prevented by the evil beings, the wights, sent there by the Witch-king some two centuries before.\nIn the end, though, Araval's bravery counted for little. His grandson Arvedui, who was born in Araval's lifetime and just thirteen years after his great victory, was to see the final destruction of the kingdom of Arthedain.\nAraval died in TA 1891 after ruling Arthedain for seventy-eight years and was succeeded by his son Araphant.[1]",

After two hundred years, the longing for the forests and wide lands overcame her, and she asked leave to depart. Turgon was unwilling, fearing the exposure of the Hidden Kingdom, but eventually relented and allowed her to leave.\nRiding with companions Glorfindel, Ecthelion, and Egalmoth,[3] they were denied entrance to Doriath, it being closed to the \u00d1oldor. However, they told her of the best way to find the Sons of F\u00ebanor, so they went around to the north. In the dangerous region of Nan Dungortheb, she was separated and reported lost. However, she reached Himlad safely and waited there to meet Celegorm, who was abroad.

Telling him of her former life and home, she desired to see them again and left Nan Elmoth with Maeglin while E\u00f6l was away. They reached Gondolin (not realizing that E\u00f6l was following them all the while) and were received with rejoicing. E\u00f6l was also discovered and brought before Turgon, but rather than accept Turgon's judgment to remain, he attempted to kill his son for disobeying him with a poisoned javelin concealed in his cloak. Aredhel stepped in front of it, was hit, and died that night from the wound due to its poison.\nE\u00f6l was cast down from the city walls and died, while Maeglin became mighty in Gondolin but later betrayed it to Morgoth.[2][4]",

Arwen, then over 2700 years old, had recently returned to her father's home after living for a while with her grandmother Galadriel in L\u00f3rien. Aragorn fell in love with Arwen at first sight, and at first mistook her for L\u00fathien, thinking he had fallen into a dream.[4]\nArwen, by Anna Kulisz\nAbout thirty years later, the two were reunited in L\u00f3rien, where Arwen reciprocated Aragorn's love and they \"plighted their troth\" (promised themselves to each other) on the mound of Cerin Amroth, Arwen choosing to become mortal and to stay in Middle-earth with Aragorn, and giving up the chance to sail over the sea and live forever in the Blessed Realm. Elrond would, however, not permit the two to marry until Aragorn had taken the thrones of Arnor and Gondor, the price for Arwen's abandonment of immortality. Arwen never broke faith with Aragorn, even when he went to war. While the War in the South raged on, Arwen wove a banner for Aragorn, which would become his standard after he became king.\nBefore taking the Paths of the Dead, Aragorn was met by the Grey Company, consisting of Rangers of the North, and Arwen's brothers, Elladan and Elrohir. They brought to him a banner of black cloth: the gift made by Arwen, and a sign that encouraged him to take the difficult path.[5] When the banner was unfurled at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields to reveal the emblems of Elendil in mithril, gems, and gold, it was the first triumphant announcement of the King's return.\nAfter the War\nQueen Arwen and King Aragorn Elessar are wed in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\nArwen arrived at Minas Tirith after Aragorn had become King of Gondor and Arnor, and they married on Midsummer's Day in the year TA 3019, after the end of the War of the Ring. She became Queen of the Reunited Kingdom. After marrying Aragorn, she bestowed upon Frodo Baggins a gift; her place on the ships to Valinor. She bore Aragorn's son, Eldarion, and several unnamed daughters, some time in the Fourth Age.\nFourth Age\nIn the year 121 of the Fourth Age, one year after Aragorn's death, Arwen died of a broken heart at Cerin Amroth in L\u00f3rien and was buried there.[2] She was 2901 years old and had been wed to Aragorn for 122 years.\n",

        "biography": "Childhood\nMuch of Frodo's youth was spent at Brandy Hall in Buckland, the ancestral home of the Brandybuck family, including his mother (Primula Brandybuck). Frodo was known as something of a rascal, befriending Meriadoc (Merry) Brandybuck and Peregrin (Pippin) Took and causing trouble wherever they went. They would often steal mushrooms from Farmer Maggot's farm Bamfurlong.[1]\nFrodo Baggins as seen by Matthew Stewart\nIn TA 2980, when Frodo was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a boating accident on the Brandywine River. An only child, Frodo stayed in Brandy Hall until his 99-year-old \"uncle\" Bilbo, his father's second cousin, adopted him in TA 2989. Bilbo took Frodo to live with him in his home at Bag End and made him his heir.[2]\nThe two grew very close in the following years; Frodo, treated by his adopted guardian as he were his own son, learned much of the Elvish language during his time with Bilbo, as well as much of the lore of Middle-earth. They also had a weekly tradition of taking long walking trips together from Hobbiton to Michel Delving and Buckland; all throughout the Shire. The two shared the same birthday, September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 12\u201314 of our calendar), and a party of special magnificence was held when Frodo came of age of thirty-three and Bilbo achieved the notable age of 111.\nBilbo gave a memorable birthday speech before playing a joke on his fellow hobbits by using the One Ring to disappear, at which Gandalf quickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash where Bilbo had been standing. The hobbits at the party were left confused and disgruntled, and Bilbo was never again seen in the Shire.\nFrodo with Bilbo during his 111th birthday\nBefore departing for his journey to Rivendell, Bilbo was persuaded by Gandalf to voluntarily surrender the One Ring. Bilbo left it on the fireplace mantel with a note for Frodo, who would now become the next Ring-bearer.\n\"The Inheritance\", by Raoul Vitale\nComing of age & flight from the Shire\nAfter the party finished, Frodo returned home and discovered that he was now the master of Bag End and the recipient of Bilbo's magic Ring. Gandalf, ever more curious about the Ring's origin, power, and purpose (but not yet positive it was the One Ring), advised the young hobbit against the using the Ring. For the next seventeen years, Frodo complied with the wizard's request and hid the Ring in a safe place. However, on April 12, 3018, Gandalf returned to Bag End and warned Frodo that the Ring was actually the One Ring, which the Dark Lord Sauron needed to rule over Middle-earth. Realizing that Sauron would be looking for the Ring, Gandalf advised the Hobbit to secretly follow Bilbo's journey to Rivendell.\nAfter Frodo's discussion with Gandalf, a rumor started that he was running out of money. This rumor, though not begun by Frodo, was encouraged by him. Merry helped Frodo to purchase a small house at Crickhollow. With the exception of his gardener Sam Gamgee, who had agreed to accompany him to Rivendell, Frodo told the other Hobbits of the Shire that he intended to move to Buckland. He sold his home to the Sackville-Bagginses, and, on the September 23, 3018, the day after his fiftieth birthday, Frodo left from Bag End, taking with him Sam and Pippin. They left in the early morning for Bree, and just in time, as Sauron's most powerful servants, the nine Nazg\u00fbl, had entered the Shire dressed as Black Riders searching for a hobbit with the name of Baggins.\nTo Bree\nFrodo was nearly captured by a Black Rider on the road, but was saved by Gildor Inglorion, whom he asked for advice. Leaving the roads to cut across country, Frodo and Sam reached Farmer Maggot's farm, who helped them to evade the Riders. Meeting Merry at Bucklebury Ferry, they saw a Rider tracking them from the bank they'd departed from. On arrival at Crickhollow, Frodo found that Merry and Pippin already knew about his \"secret\" journey. Frodo was left with no alternative but to bring the two youngsters with him. They cut through the Old Forest and the Barrow-downs in hopes of losing the Black Riders, which did succeed. They met other troubles in those places though, at the hands of Old Man Willow and the Barrow-wights, but were rescued twice by Tom Bombadil, a mysterious being who dwelt in a glade in the middle of the Old Forest.\nStrider\nFrodo meeting Strider at The Prancing Pony\nIn Bree, the hobbits stayed at The Prancing Pony, an old inn. Frodo went by the name of Mr Underhill, attempting to raise as little suspicion as possible. When he noticed a mysteriously cloaked Man sitting in the shadows and smoking a long-stemmed pipe, Frodo asked the innkeeper, Barliman Butterbur, who the man was. The innkeeper referred to the man, a Ranger, as Strider.\nThat night, Black Riders arrived in Bree and attacked the inn in search of Frodo and the One Ring, but Strider had managed to hide the Hobbits from them in time. Having gained their trust, Strider introduced himself as Aragorn to Frodo and the others, to whom he also revealed the backstory of the black riders, also called Nazg\u00fbl or Ringwraiths. With a pony named Bill that the Hobbits had acquired at Bree, Strider led Frodo and his companions into the Wild. Aragorn would be their guide to Rivendell, and he would lead them through the Midgewater Marshes and to the hill of Weathertop.\nWeathertop\nOn the night of October the sixth, the Hobbits were attacked by five of the nine Ringwraiths at Weathertop. In the presence of the Nazg\u00fbl, Frodo made the mistake of putting on the Ring. He was able to resist their attempt to take him by drawing his sword and invoking the name of one of the Valar, Elbereth Gilthoniel. Unfortunately, the leader of the Nazg\u00fbl, the Witch-king of Angmar, stabbed Frodo in the shoulder (he would have stabbed his heart) with a Morgul-knife. If it had caught him in the heart, Frodo would have become like the Nazg\u00fbl, only weaker and under their control. The Ringwraiths were driven away by the appearance of Aragorn and his martial skill; also because he had torches, one of their few weaknesses.\nThough Aragorn was a skilled healer, he could not heal Frodo's wound. A fragment of the Ringwraith's blade remained in Frodo's flesh, where it continued to move towards his heart. Near death (or worse), Frodo was rescued by Glorfindel, an Elf-lord, who put the injured Hobbit upon his horse Asfaloth. They were found and pursued by the Nazg\u00fbl, as Glorfindel rode and bore Frodo swiftly to the Ford of Bruinen, at the entrance to the valley of Rivendell. Once they had crossed the River Bruinen, the Nine Ringwraiths behind them demanded Frodo give up the Ring, but Frodo refused. Subsequently, the Ringwraiths entered the river and were washed away in a flood called up by Elrond.\nThe Hobbits reuniting in Rivendell\nFrodo was soon healed in Rivendell by Elrond, who knew the wound would not ultimately leave him, as it was both spiritual and physical. On the 24th of October 3018, Frodo awoke in Rivendell and was reunited with Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Although Elrond had healed his wound, it continued to ail him yearly for as long as he lived in Middle-earth.\nQuest of the Ring\nCouncil of Elrond\nFrodo placing the One Ring before the Council of Elrond\nAfter his healing, Frodo was summoned to a great Council that Elrond had organized. Representatives of all the Free Peoples of Middle-earth discussed the history of the Rings of Power and decided that the One Ring must be destroyed. As the Ring was shown and tempers flared, argument broke out as to who should carry the Ring on this mission, until Frodo bravely volunteered to take the Ring to Mordor and cast it into the fires of Mount Doom. A member of each of the Free Peoples offered to join Frodo in his quest, thus forming the Fellowship of the Ring.\nThe Fellowship consisted of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Boromir of Gondor, Legolas of the Woodland Realm, and Gimli of the Lonely Mountain. Before leaving Rivendell, Bilbo gave Frodo his dwarf-made coat of mithril mail and his elven blade Sting. The mithril coat had been given to Bilbo by Thorin Oakenshield during the events of The Hobbit, and Sting had been taken by Bilbo from a troll den. On December 25, the Fellowship of the Ring departed from Rivendell and headed south.\nMoria\nThe Hobbits of the Fellowship of the Ring prepare to battle goblins in Moria\nAfter an attack by White Wolves in Eregion, on January 11, 3019, the Fellowship attempted to cross the Misty Mountains (specifically the Pass of Caradhras), but were unable to due to a snowstorm. They instead traveled through the underground city of Moria at the urging of Gimli.\nSome days in into their dangerous trek through Moria, the Fellowship entered the Chamber of Mazarbul, and was attacked by Orcs and a cave-troll. Frodo helped to defeat the troll before he was stabbed by an Orc captain, his mithril-shirt saving him from a deadly blow. The Fellowship then ran from there to the Bridge of Khazad-dum, at which Gandalf dueled Durin's Bane and fell. Once outside Moria, while the Fellowship was grieving, Gimli took Frodo and Sam to look upon the Mirrormere, even in their great hurry.\nLothl\u00f3rien\nGaladriel and Frodo\nDeeply grieved by their loss, the Fellowship journeyed to the Elven kingdom of Lothl\u00f3rien, where they met the Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn. Galadriel showed Frodo a vision of the future in her Mirror. Frodo offered her the One Ring, but she resisted the temptation to take it, passing the test that was laid before her, and accepting the diminishing of the power of the Elves. Before the Fellowship departed from Lothl\u00f3rien, Galadriel gave each member a gift. To Frodo, she gave a phial with the light of the star E\u00e4rendil captured inside; this gift would prove hugely important later on in the quest. They were also provided with elven way-bread, other supplies, and boats for their voyage down the Anduin River.\nThe Breaking of the Fellowship\nFrodo puts on the One Ring to hide from Boromir, near Amon Hen\nThe Fellowship continued their journey south to Parth Galen. There, Boromir, a Man of Gondor and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to convince Frodo to bring the Ring to Minas Tirith and regroup from there. When the hobbit asked for an hour alone to consider his options, Boromir followed him. Seeing that Frodo did not intend to take the suggested course of action, Boromir tried to take the Ring from him by force.\nFrodo put on the Ring and escaped to the Seat of Seeing, where he watched as war brewed across Middle-earth and the Eye of Sauron searching for him as he traveled. He was nearly spotted, but the Dark Lord's attention was drawn away by a resurrected Gandalf.\nTaking off the Ring, he decided to take the item to Mordor alone, without telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was joined by his friend Samwise Gamgee, who felt it was necessary that he should protect and guide Frodo. Frodo gave in to Sam's protests, and although reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have Sam's company.\nThe two hobbits continued toward Mordor, dividing the Fellowship. Meanwhile, Boromir was killed by Uruk-archers while defending Merry and Pippin; the two young hobbits were then captured by Uruk-hai, and were to be taken to Isengard. Instead of following Samwise and Frodo to Mordor, the Three Hunters, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, decided it more important to rescue Merry and Pippin from their captors. The breaking of the Fellowship was now complete.\nEmyn Muil\nFrodo and Sam journey towards Mordor\nAfter leaving what remained of the Fellowship at Amon Hen, Frodo and Sam tried to navigate through the winding paths and razor sharp rocks of the Emyn Muil. After getting lost several times, they were found by Gollum, who at first tried to take the One Ring, but was captured by Sam (with Frodo's help) and tied up with the Elven rope. Frodo, now pitying the creature, decided not to slay Gollum, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude to the master of the precious. Gollum then led them out of the maze and into the Dead Marshes.\nThe Dead Marshes\nFrodo amid the Marshes\nThe Dead Marshes lay to the south of Emyn Muil, and were just as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route through the marshes, as Orcs marched for miles around, although Gollum had secretly discovered a path when traveling. He led Frodo and Sam on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them not to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.\nSoon after Frodo, Samwise, and Gollum entered the Dead Marshes, a Nazg\u00fbl flew over them on a Fellbeast, looking for the Ring. Gollum had led the two hobbits to a safe place that they could hide in.\nIthilien\nGollum led the two Hobbits to the Black Gate of Mordor, as Frodo had desired, but stopped the Hobbits from passing its doors, as the danger was too great. He then explained about a secret way into Mordor, 'Up the stairs and through the tunnel'. The Hobbits once again found themselves being led by Gollum. After venturing into Ithilien, and witnessing a skirmish between a company of Haradrim warriors (along with Oliphaunts) and Rangers from Gondor, they were apprehended by the Ranger's captain, Faramir. When the skirmish had ended, Faramir blindfolded the ring-bearer and his companions and led them to Henneth Ann\u00fbn, the Window on the West. Upon much interrogation, Sam foolishly misspoke, and gave away that Frodo was indeed carrying the One Ring. Realizing the importance of the quest, Faramir proved his quality, unlike his brother, Boromir, and let the Ring-bearer go free, resupplying the hobbits with food for their journey. Later, Gollum was captured in the Forbidden Pool and forcibly taken into the hidden lair. Frodo begged for his safety, and he was not killed, although the rift between master and servant had once again begun to open.\nFrodo, weary, with Sam and Gollum on the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, by Stephen Hickman\nMinas Morgul and Shelob's Lair\nGollum led the hobbits past the lair of the Witch-king of Angmar, Minas Morgul, and up the Stairs of Cirith Ungol into 'The Tunnel'. When they arrived at the top though, they were abandoned by Gollum, causing them to realize that Gollum had betrayed them. They cautiously traveled through the tunnel, and managed to get to the end only to find their way barred by Shelob's great web. Whilst attempting to cut through the webbing, Frodo bravely stood up to Shelob and forced her back further into the tunnels giving him and Sam time enough to hack through the threads and escape. Upon escaping the tunnels, Frodo thought himself safe; however, Shelob, through one of her many tunnels, managed to sneak out and jab him with her stinger. As he was being encased in Shelob's webbing, Sam was able to draw her into single combat wherein he, using Sting and the Phial of Galadriel, was able to mortally wound her and drive her back into her caves. Sam took the Ring from around Frodo's neck upon hearing Orcish voices, and hid behind some nearby rocks. He overheard the Orcs speaking of Frodo, and Sam realized that his master was not dead, but merely paralyzed. Frodo was then taken to the Tower of Cirith Ungol to await further torture and questioning.\nFrodo prior to being poisoned by Shelob\nCirith Ungol\nFrodo was imprisoned on the highest floor of the Tower. He was stripped of all his clothes and possessions. Fighting broke out amongst the two lead Orcs and their battalions from squabbling over claim of the mithril vest - in this violence almost all Orcs and Uruks in the tower died. Sam soon arrived at the gate of the Tower, only to find his way blocked by the Two Watchers; he eventually overcame them, entered the tower, finding and rescuing his master. They descended and fled the tower, having to pass the Watchers again (this time, destroying them), and entered Mordor.\nMordor and Mount Doom\nFrodo and Sam crawled onward through the plains of Mordor, which lay vacant as many hosts of Orcs were sent to the Black Gate to meet the Men of the West's army, and, after falling in and out of one such company of Orcs, started to climb Mount Doom. They journeyed on for days with little food or water, and Frodo became progressively weaker as the Ring's power over him grew the closer they drew to Orodruin. Frodo was eventually unable to go on, and Sam was forced to carry him a fair distance. It was then that Gollum reappeared, and, after a brief struggle, Sam cut Gollum in the stomach while Frodo fled up the mountain to its entrance.\nFrodo missing a finger\nInside the Cracks of Doom, Frodo finally had the chance to destroy the Ring and relieve his burden, but the Ring's power was at its strongest due to the surroundings where it had been created. Frodo finally yielded to the temptation and power of the Ring. Sam yelled for Frodo to destroy it, but Frodo, overcome by its power, claimed the Ring for himself aloud. Gollum attacked Sam, who fell and hit his head on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When he regained consciousness, he saw Gollum fighting with an invisible Frodo. Gollum bit off Frodo's finger that wore the Ring, causing Frodo great pain, and he was reunited with his treasure for a short time, until, dancing with joy, he toppled off the brink and fell into the lava, destroying himself and the One Ring.\nSam and Frodo after the completion of their quest\nThe two hobbits tried to escape as Mount Doom erupted. In the very moment that they believed themselves doomed, Gwaihir the Lord of Eagles saw them, and, with his Eagle companions Landroval and Meneldor, rescued Sam and Frodo, and flew them westward, out of Mordor to safety.\nEnd of the War\nThe Scouring of the Shire\nAfter recovering at the Field of Cormallen and witnessing the crowning of Aragorn as King Elessar, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin all returned to the Shire. Arriving, they found it under the control of one Sharkey (later revealed to be Saruman) and his forces. Saruman was ruling the Shire from Bag End, although he was later murdered by Gr\u00edma Wormtongue. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, however, started to gather all Shirriffs and townsfolk of the Shire, and they successfully defeated of Saruman's Ruffians at the Battle of Bywater.\nFrodo was not directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of Bywater; instead, he made sure that no hobbits were harmed (saying that no Hobbit had ever intentionally harmed another in the Shire, and that this would stay true), and also that any Ruffians that surrendered were not harmed.\nClose of the Third Age\nFollowing the Scouring of the Shire and end of the War of the Ring in November, Frodo went on to serve as Deputy Mayor of the Shire. During his brief tenure of six months, he helped lead the rebuilding of the Shire, but soon realized that he still bore the wounds of his quest. On May 1st, TA 3020, Frodo attended the wedding of his best friend Sam and his wife Rosie Cotton and they moved in with him at Bag End. On mid-years day later that year, Frodo retired from his post as Deputy Mayor, letting the office revert to Will Whitfoot, who Frodo held place for as he recovered from his wounds and imprisonment by Saruman.\nDuring his last days in middle-earth, he tried to live as peacefully as possible. Frodo was still troubled by his shoulder wound, which pained him on each anniversary of the attack at Weathertop, in addition to falling sick on each anniversary of being stung by Shelob. As such, October 6th of that year, he would suffer from his wounds again. March 13th, TA 3021 brought similar ailments, Frodo being ill from his stinging. While living with Sam and Rosie he would witness the birth of their oldest daughter Elanor twelve days later. Prior to departing Middle-earth, he also wrote his own story \"The Lord of the Rings\" along with Bilbo's \"There and Back Again\" in the Red Book of Westmarch.\nOn September 22, TA 3021 (Third Age), at the age of 53, Frodo joined Bilbo, Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel aboard the White Ship at the Grey Havens. He was allowed passage across the sea to the Undying Lands, as he was a Ring-bearer, with the hope of healing the damage to his spirit that bearing the Ring had caused.[3]\nFourth Age\nDuring the Fourth Age, Frodo spent his last days on Tol Eress\u00eba in \"a period of reflection and peace\", attempting to understand his place in Arda, having been given the opportunity as he healed from the trauma afflicted upon him due to his quest during the War of the Ring.[3]\nIn the year FA 61, fellow Ring-bearer Samwise Gamgee, sailed to the Undying Lands, possibly reuniting with Frodo, assuming he was still alive.",

        "biography": "Early life\nBalin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thr\u00e1in II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself. Thr\u00e1in was captured and lost.[1]\nQuest of Erebor\nBalin was part of the company assembled by Thorin Oakenshield in TA 2941 that journeyed to the Lonely Mountain with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf to defeat Smaug, and to retake the kingdom of Erebor. He was the second Dwarf to arrive at Bilbo's home, where, like his brother Dwalin, he played a viol as big as himself.[2] Following the meeting's conclusion and the company's initial departure to the Green Dragon Inn, Balin spotted Bilbo hurrying to reach them before they set out.[3]\nBalin visits Bilbo in The Hobbit films\nBalin, along with his companions, underwent the journey through the Trollshaws and Lone-lands to Rivendell, including the encounter with the trolls Tom, Bert, and William.[3] The company rested in Rivendell for some time, and after setting out to cross the Misty Mountains, were captured by Orcs on the High Pass, after taking refuge from a thunderstorm.[4] With Gandalf's help, the Dwarves escaped, and subsequently Balin was posted as a lookout when Bilbo returned, having been separated from the company during their flight. Due to Bilbo's usage of the One Ring, which he had discovered in the Orc tunnels, the Hobbit crept by Balin unnoticed, puzzling the Dwarf a great deal. Soon afterwards, the company was beset by Wargs, which forced them to climb a number of pine trees until their rescue by the Great Eagles.[5]\nThe Eagles took them to their eyrie, and then to the Carrock, from whence the company traveled to the Beorn's hall.[5] Gandalf decided to introduce the Dwarves by pairs so as not to overwhelm Beorn, and Balin and Dwalin were chosen to come first. Having been welcomed by the skin-changer and given rest and provisions, the company set out to cross the forest of Mirkwood.[6] Despite having been warned to the contrary, the Dwarves eventually left the path after running low on supplies, and were soon waylaid by great spiders, which intended to eat them. Bilbo used the Ring to escape notice, and returned to free them. Balin afterwards led the company in escaping from and fighting off the spiders, though the Dwarves were captured by Wood-elves, and taken to the hall of the Elvenking, Thranduil. It was here that Balin spoke for his companions, arguing for their release. Thranduil refused, and imprisoned the Dwarves, until Bilbo again rescued the company.[7]\nThe Dwarves came to Lake-town,[8] and then to the Lonely Mountain. After opening the Side-door to the mountain,[9] Balin was the only member of the company willing to go with Bilbo some way inside. The hobbit, after unintentionally disturbing the dragon Smaug, returned to the Dwarves, but Smaug left his lair and attempted to kill the Dwarves before turning to Lake-town, with the intent to destroy it.[10] The dragon was there slain by Bard, and the Dwarves took possession of the mountain.[11] Thorin and Balin, not long after, came upon the raven Ro\u00e4c, who brought word of the dragon's demise.[12]\nBalin fought in and survived the subsequent Battle of Five Armies, which was fought against Orcs led by Bolg, after tensions with the Lake-men and Wood-elves had run high, due to a disagreement about the division of Smaug's treasure.[13] He took up residence at the Lonely Mountain afterwards with the surviving members of the company.\nVisiting Bilbo\nSeven years after the Quest for Erebor, Balin accompanied Gandalf to visit Bilbo in the Shire in TA 2949, since the two had become good friends during their travels. He and Gandalf gave Bilbo the news of current happenings in Middle-earth.[14]\nSometime afterward in the coming years before his expedition in TA 2989, Balin would visit Bilbo at least one more time. During this visit to the Shire, Balin met Bilbo's newly adopted heir of Bag End, Frodo, and the young Hobbit would come to learn of some of Balin and his Uncle's travels to the lonely mountain.\nExpedition into Moria\nBalin at his death bed\nIn TA 2989,[14] Balin led an expedition in an attempt to reclaim the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria, hoping to re-establish Dwarven rule and to reclaim the last of the Seven Rings of the Dwarves.[15] Though his king did not give his consent, Balin and company went anyway. Among his numbers were fellow members of Thorin's company \u00d3in and Ori. While in Moria, he discovered Durin's Axe and a Mithril helm (possibly the crown of Durin l) and claimed them as his own. After the discovery of these items Balin, being a descendant of the line of Durin, claimed rulership over the Dwarven realm, taking the title Lord of Moria (his colony being too small to be counted as a kingdom). Ultimately, the search for the ring, which conferred great wealth and a curse of greed on its owner, was in vain, as it had been taken from Thr\u00e1in II by Sauron.\nDeath\nAfter ruling as Moria's Lord for about five years, Balin was slain by Orcs on November 10 TA 2994,[14] after going to look upon the Mirromere alone. His body was recovered after a battle, and entombed in the Chamber of Mazarbul. The attempt to retake Moria ultimately failed afterward, as the rest of his kin were eventually trapped and killed.[16] Ironically, he died in the same place and the same way as his father had been slain 195 years before in TA 2799.[citation needed]\nLegacy\nBalin's tomb at the time of the Fellowship's arrival\nSome twenty-five years later in TA 3019, the Fellowship of the Ring passed through Moria and discovered Balin's tomb, and the truth of what happened to his expedition, which had not previously been known, in the Book of Mazarbul. The knowledge of this brought much grief to Balin's cousin Gimli, who was a member of the fellowship.[16]",

After the Dagor Bragollach by FA 456,[1] Barahir lived with his faithful XII B\u00eborings on the highland of Dorthonion at Tarn Aeluin as outlaws defying the will of Morgoth, whose forces hunted him and his company like wild beasts.[5] The members of Barahir's XII B\u00eborings was his son Beren, his nephews Baragund the elder and Belegund the younger, Radhruin and Dairuin, Dagnir and Ragnor, Gildor and Gorlim the Unhappy, Arthad, and Urthel, and Hathaldir the Young. As for his wife Emeldir, she parted from Barahir when she became the leader of the women and children of B\u00ebor's folk that fled Dorthonion. For her bravery in this, Barahir's wife was known as Emeldir the Man-hearted,\nFor five years, Barahir led his doomed band of outlaws until FA 460 when they were betrayed to Sauron by Gorlim, a lovesick member of Barahir's outlaw band and Barahir was killed at Tarn Aeluin, along with everyone in his company save for Beren his son, who was gone on an errand for them and thus luckily happened to not be there. Barahir's remains were buried in a cairn by his son at Tarn Aeluin, other than his hand which was chopped off by Gorgol, an Orc captain of Sauron. Beren later slew Gorgol and recovered the Ring of Barahir. Barahir's son then escaped Dorthonion after all and lived on to fulfil a great destiny.[6]\nLegacy[]\nBarahir's service to Finrod and House of Finarfin left behind a legacy of respect between the House of B\u00ebor, later generations of Men, and Elves. This friendship led to the close association of the Elves and the D\u00fanedain of N\u00famenor and Arnor and Gondor.

        "biography": "Bard the Bowman\nBard was descended from Lord Girion of Dale, whose wife and child had escaped to Lake-town when Smaug ruined Dale and took the Lonely Mountain in TA 2770.\nIn TA 2941, when Smaug emerged from the Lonely Mountain and attacked Lake-town, Bard, as captain of a company of town archers, was encouraging the archers and urging the town Master to order them to fight to the last arrow. Bard himself fired many arrows with his great yew bow. He was down to his last arrow when a thrush came and perched over his shoulder. Because Bard was of the race of Dale, he was able to understand the thrush's words. The bird told him of the weak spot in Smaug's armor that Bilbo Baggins had discovered. Bard fired his Black Arrow\u00a0and struck the hollow by Smaug's left breast and the dragon fell from the sky, landing on Lake-town and destroying it.[2]\nBard escaped into the lake and swam ashore. The people wanted him to be their King, but he said he would continue to serve the Master of Lake-town for the time being. Bard took charge of organizing shelter and aid for the refugees and sent messages to the Elvenking of Mirkwood asking for help. Then, Bard and the Elvenking led their forces to the Lonely Mountain, seeking a share of the treasure.[3]\nWhen they arrived at the Lonely Mountain, they were surprised to find Thorin II and his company of Dwarves still alive. Bard sought reparations from Thorin on the grounds that it was he who had slain Smaug, that part of the Dragon\u2019s treasure had once belonged to Dale, and that the people of Lake-town were suffering and needed aid. Thorin said that the destruction of Lake-town was not his responsibility and he refused to parley with armies camped outside the mountain. Bard sent a messenger several hours later asking for one-twelfth of the treasure, but again Thorin refused.[3]\nBilbo Baggins thought that Bard's claims were reasonable, so one night he went secretly to the camp of the Lake-men and Elves. The Hobbit had found the Arkenstone - the treasure that Thorin most desired - and he offered it to Bard and Thranduil to use to negotiate. He also told them that an army of 500 Dwarves led by D\u00e1in Ironfoot was coming from the Iron Hills.[4]\nThe next day, Bard asked Thorin for a portion of the treasure in exchange for the Arkenstone. Thorin was enraged, but he reluctantly agreed to give up Bilbo's one-fourteenth share. D\u00e1in's army arrived the next day, and Bard tried to prevent them from entering the Lonely Mountain until the exchange for the Arkenstone had been made. A battle seemed imminent, but then Gandalf told them that an army of goblins and Wargs were approaching. Bard, Thranduil, and D\u00e1in took council together and they joined forces to fight their common enemy in the Battle of Five Armies. During the battle, Thorin emerged from the mountain and rallied Dwarves, Elves, and Men to the attack, but he was mortally wounded. Bard laid the Arkenstone upon Thorin's breast when he was buried under the mountain, and D\u00e1in agreed to pay the one-fourteenth share of the treasure as promised. Bard gave the emeralds of Girion to Thranduil in gratitude for his assistance. Bard also contributed gold for the rebuilding of Lake-town, and although the Master of Lake-town absconded with much of it, Lake-town was rebuilt and its people became prosperous.[5]\nBard the Bowman as portrayed by Luke Evans in The Hobbit films\nBard went to his ancestral home of Dale at the foot of the Lonely Mountain. He rebuilt the ruined town and in TA 2944, he became King of Dale. Bard maintained good relations with the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain and trade flowed freely up and down the River Running. People came to settle in Dale from miles around and the land that had been withered by Smaug became bountiful once more.[1]\nBard died in TA 2977. His son Bain succeeded him as King of Dale.[1]",

Beorn kept many animals at his residence, such as horses, dogs, and sheep. His animals were all extremely intelligent; his dogs, for instance, could walk on their hind legs while carrying things with their forelegs, set the table, and able to speak. Beorn's horses could also understand what their master said. Beorn was also capable of speaking in the tongue of beasts, as he could communicate with bears. When he spoke to his dogs, his words sounded like \"barks twisted into some form of speech\".[1]\nQuest of Erebor[]\nIn the year TA 2941, Beorn granted shelter to Thorin and Company, which included Gandalf and the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. Beorn, though not over fond of Dwarves, provided the company with food, supplies, and guidance after being humored by Gandalf's telling of the company's story. The company then left Beorn to travel through Mirkwood, though the Beorning warned them not to drink from the Enchanted stream within the forest.[1]\nBeorn, in bear-form, facing Bolg after scattering his guard, by Justin Gerard\nSome months later, word came to Beorn of impending trouble at Erebor, and he arrived in time to take part in the Battle of Five Armies, where he bore Thorin from the battlefield after the Dwarf was mortally wounded. Beorn later accompanied Gandalf and Bilbo on their return journey as far as his home, where he allowed the two to stay over the winter.[2]\nBeorn's two visages, by Antonio Vinci\nLater years[]\nIn the years following the Battle of Five Armies, Beorn became a great chieftain among the folk of the Vales of Anduin and his followers became known as the Beornings. At some point he became the father of Grimbeorn, later known as Grimbeorn the Old. Before the War of the Ring, Beorn passed away,[3] and his son Grimbeorn succeeded him as chieftain.[4]",

        "biography": "Life in Dorthonion[]\nBeren was one of the Edain (Men), the son of Barahir and Emeldir\u00a0the man-hearted. He was of the noble House of B\u00ebor of Dorthonion and was the most accomplished hero and adventurer of the First Age. The battle of the Dagor Bragollach befell during his youth, bringing about the ruin of his people. The young Beren lived with his father and eleven loyal followers in the highlands of Dorthonion, and the thirteen of them performed many acts of bravery, to the great frustration of Morgoth, the Dark Lord of Angband.\nThe encounter of Beren and L\u00fathien by Marinela Mexi\nAfter the ruin of the XII B\u00eborings of Dorthonion and the death of his father, Beren hunted the Orcs responsible, killing Gorgol and reclaiming the hand of his father and Ring of Barahir. After this he lived alone off the land in Dorthonion; he came to know the many birds and beasts that lived there, and they helped him when he had need. During this time, he hunted nothing and ate no meat and killed only the creatures of Morgoth that roamed the country. He learned not to fear death, only captivity and bondage; however, things began to grow more difficult for him, for Morgoth put an even greater price on his head and he was forced from the land of his birth by Sauron and Draugluin. He passed through the forests of Nan Dungortheb, then into Doriath, breaching the Girdle of Melian as prophesied, where he saw and fell in love with L\u00fathien, princess of the Sindar and daughter of Thingol and Melian.[6]\n\nQuest for the Silmaril[]\nBeren before L\u00fathien in Menegroth, by Donato Giancola\n\"A moment of fleeting peace\" By Sepide Donne\nThingol haughtily refused to give L\u00fathien's hand in marriage. He said that he would allow the marriage only if Beren brought back a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth. The task was intended to be impossible, but Beren and L\u00fathien, with the aid of Finrod of Nargothrond and Huan the Great Hound, braved many perils (even besting Sauron, then Morgoth's most powerful lieutenant) and took a Silmaril. However, as they escaped from Angband, the great wolf Carcharoth, whom Morgoth had personally bred, awoke. Beren held out the Silmaril, hoping that its radiance would avert the beast, but he was mistaken. Carcharoth bit off his hand, swallowed it and the Silmaril (thus Beren was called Erchamion, One-hand), and proceeded to run rampant through Doriath. L\u00fathien and the unconscious Beren were rescued by the Eagles of Manw\u00eb. When he presented himself to Thingol, he proclaimed to the Elven king that he even now had a Silmaril in his hand. When Thingol demanded that Beren present the jewel, he held forth the stump of his hand, and he was then given the name Camlost, Empty-handed. He and L\u00fathien then told Thingol of their quest. Thingol was utterly astonished by Beren's tale, and though Beren bore no Silmaril upon him, he gave his permission for Beren and L\u00fathien to wed. For the sheer improbability of Beren's success had demonstrated to Thingol that Beren was no mere Man, for he and L\u00fathien had achieved what all the hosts of the Elves and Edain had never come even close to accomplishing. Beren participated in the hunting of Carcharoth, where the beast was slain and the Silmaril recovered; the quest was accomplished, but in the process Beren was mortally wounded.[6]\nSecond life[]\nL\u00fathien's love for Beren was so strong that, upon hearing of his death, she lay down and died. Her soul went to the Halls of Mandos, where she managed to charm Mandos into granting her a wish. Both she and Beren were miraculously restored to life, but both of them would live as mortals and die the death of Men, and go beyond the walls of Arda to a place unknown. Thus Beren and L\u00fathien lived again, and dwelt on Tol Galen in the middle of the river Adurant in Ossiriand. There they stayed apart from other mortals; Beren was involved with the events of the First Age only one further time, when he waylaid a group of Dwarves who had sacked Menegroth and stolen the Nauglam\u00edr (and the Silmaril with it).[6]\nBeren being revived by L\u00fathien - by Justin Gerard\nL\u00fathien bore Beren a son, named Dior, Thingol's heir, considered to be one of the fairest beings to ever live, for in him flowed the blood of Men, of Elves, and of the Ainur. Through his descendants, the blood of Beren and of L\u00fathien was preserved among the Eldar and the Edain.[6]\nLegacy[]\nBeren's deeds inspired all the peoples opposing Morgoth to unite themselves into a greater force to vanquish his power, resulting in the valiant but doomed Union of Maedhros.[7] His romance and love for L\u00fathien Tin\u00faviel and what he was willing to do to ensure it helped foster greater respect for men amongst the Elves.\nThe union of Beren and L\u00fathien was the first between a mortal Man and an Elven maid. His granddaughter Elwing married Earendil, son of Tuor and Idril, thus becoming the great-grandfather of Elrond and Elros, the first being one of the most influential figures of the Second and Third Age and the second the first King of N\u00famenor. Her lineage passed down to the royal House of Elros of N\u00famenor, and then to the House of Elendil, and on to the Kings of the Reunited Kingdom and beyond. Beren's romance with L\u00fathien is one of the great stories of the Elder Days, and it is mirrored by the later romance between their descendants Aragorn and Arwen Evenstar. According to legend, his line would never be broken as long as the world lasted.\nA depiction of Beren",

He was one of the few children that were permitted to remain in Minas Tirith when the civilian population was evacuated prior to the assault by Mordor. He guided Peregrin Took throughout the city when he and Gandalf arrived, and they became very good friends in the process. Before the attack began, Bergil and Pippin witnessed the arrival of reinforcements from other parts of Gondor to defend the city. During the Siege of Minas Tirith, Bergil helped the healers of the city as an errand runner and so eventually contributed to the healing of Faramir, the Steward's son and later Prince of Ithilien.\nBergil who, running errands for the healers of Minas Tirith, told Gandalf where Pippin and the injured Meriadoc Brandybuck were; Merry, suffering from the Black Breath, had gotten lost during the battle on the Fields of Pelennor. He was also the one who brought the Athelas leaves to Aragorn; at that time, he showed his love for Faramir by bursting into tears. Bergil also kept Merry company while the Captains of the West led their men off to the Black Gate and then escorted him back to the Houses of Healing.[1]\nOf Bergil's destiny the novel or its appendices tell nothing. It is probable that he went with his father into Ithilien after the War of the Ring was over. His younger brother Borlas was central to \"The New Shadow\", the soon-abandoned draft for a The Lord of the Rings sequel.[2]",

        "biography": "Bilbo's home of Bag End, by Soni Alcorn-Hender\nChildhood\nBilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire-reckoning (around September 12\u201314 of our calendar), in the year 2890 of the Third Age. He was the only son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took.\nIn Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious Hobbit-hole for Belladonna, which they named Bag End. The family moved to their new home, where Bilbo would spend much of his life.\nAs a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside world. The Istar wizard, Gandalf, took interest in this unusual quality in Bilbo during his visits to the Shire. Bilbo would later remember Gandalf's fireworks in the dwelling of his mother's family at Great Smials. Bilbo apparently practiced his rock-throwing skills in his youth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever he bent down to pick up a rock.\nWhen Bilbo's father and mother died in TA 2926 and TA 2934 respectively, Bilbo became his own master and spent the next seven years living alone in Bag End. During this time, Bilbo grew fond of his life as a wealthy bachelor and acquired a reputation for respectability that the neighbors admired.\nBilbo, middle aged, with Gandalf, by Inger Ederfeldt\nQuest of Erebor\nMain article: Quest of Erebor\n\nAn Unexpected Journey\nIn the year TA 2941, Bilbo, at the age of 50, was visited by Gandalf, whom he had not seen for quite some time, outside his home at Bag End. Gandalf invited Bilbo on an unspecified adventure, which was flatly refused by the hobbit, who bade the wizard a \"Good morning\", and went inside.\nUndeterred, Gandalf continued in his plan, sending thirteen Dwarves, led by Thorin II, to Bag End the very day. These Dwarves, needing an additional member for their company, initially came by pairs, and lastly with Gandalf, who had himself selected Bilbo as the best person for the Dwarves' job. The Dwarves explained to Bilbo their background and purpose; that they were among the Dwarves of Erebor who had been forced from Erebor when the dragon Smaug attacked and taken up residence there. They now had determined to reclaim the mountain and needed a \"burglar\" to help them in situations requiring stealth. Bilbo reluctantly agreed to go, and the next morning they set off from the Green Dragon Inn.[1]\nThorin and company traveled through the Lone-lands along high hills and beside castles. After approximately one month since their outset, Gandalf disappeared. \u00d3in and Gl\u00f3in failed to make a fire during a rainy night, and Balin spotted a fire in the distance, which was rare in those regions, and sent Bilbo to investigate. At the fire were three Stone-trolls, Tom, Bert, and William. Bilbo attempted to snatch something from the trolls to bring back to the Dwarves, to show that he was a first-class burglar. However, he was caught by William, but he escaped and was helpless to prevent all the Dwarves from being captured when they came looking for him. Fortunately for the Dwarves, Gandalf returned and saved them all by imitating the trolls' voices and tricking the trolls into arguing with one another until daybreak, which turned them all to stone.\nBilbo as portrayed by Martin Freeman\nAfter rescuing the party, the wizard led Bilbo and the party to the Trolls' lair, which the trolls had used to hide their treasure and shield themselves from the sun during the daylight hours. In the cave, a number of weapons were found, Glamdring (Beater) and Orcrist (Biter) among them. Bilbo took an Elvish dagger from the trolls' collection, no longer than a small knife in size, which he would later name Sting. He kept it with him for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.[2]\nIn June the company came to Rivendell. During their visit, Bilbo met Lord Elrond, and became enchanted with the Elves. On midsummer eve Elrond inspected the swords of Thorin and Gandalf and looked at Thr\u00f3r's Map, which Gandalf had previously given to Thorin at the behest of Thorin's father Thr\u00e1in II. Elrond explained that the swords were forged in Gondolin and were named Orcrist and Glamdring. When inspecting the map Elrond found Moon-letters that spoke of the Side-door of Erebor, which read: Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.[3]\nDiscovery of the One Ring\nBilbo and his companions then traveled from Rivendell and made their way to the High Pass of the Misty Mountains, where they witnessed the distant thunder-battle of giants. It was here the company, after taking shelter in what they took to be a simple cave, were captured by Orcs and taken to Goblin-town. With Gandalf's help, they escaped from the Great Goblin and his servants. Dori, however, who was carrying Bilbo, was grabbed from behind by an orc, and in the ensuing struggle Bilbo lost consciousness and was inadvertently left by his companions.[4]\nBilbo finds The One Ring\nComing to and finding himself alone, Bilbo crawled his way through the pitch-black tunnel, using his hobbit nose to gain a sense of direction. He eventually stumbled upon a small Ring, but thought nothing of it, and put it in his back pocket. Although he did not know it, this lost trinket was the One Ring, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron thousands of years ago. Bilbo soon encountered Gollum, who had been in possession of the Ring for over five hundred years. The two challenged each other to a Riddle-game with the condition that Gollum would show the way out if Bilbo won. However, Gollum was not satisfied with Bilbo's final riddle, and while mourning his loss, found that his Ring was gone. Gollum then realized the answer to Bilbo's riddle, \"What have I got in my pocket?\" and paddled back on his boat towards Bilbo, who he then accused of stealing his precious, but Bilbo had vanished.[5]\nGollum and Bilbo in Gollum's cave, by Michael Herring, as cover art for Ballantine Books' The Hobbit (1983)\nGollum, thinking Bilbo had known the way out and was leaving, headed to the exit and was followed by Bilbo. Bilbo was soon reunited with his companions. Bilbo and the travelers had stopped for the night when orcs and a pack of Wargs found them near a patch of pine trees. The Dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf climbed up the trees to escape, but the orcs were not going to leave without killing them. They started to burn the trees down. The chief wolf was ordering the other wargs around when Gandalf picked up a pinecone, and with his magic set it ablaze in a green fire. He threw it down hitting the chieftain. It rolled around on the ground burning while Gandalf threw more and more pinecones down. The goblins and wargs fled and the group was rescued by the Great Eagles. When one of the eagles grabbed Dori, Bilbo had to jump and grab Dori's legs before he was forgotten. This prompted Bilbo to groan \"My arms! My poor arms,\" and Dori to cry, \"My legs! My poor legs!\" The eagles eventually took them to the Great Shelf where they rested and continued their journey.[6]\nInto Wilderland\nThe group traveled to Beorn's hall where they rested, after being gruffly taken in by Beorn and his animal servants. Beorn learned their story and gave a large number of provisions to help their quest. Beorn also lent several ponies to be used until the group reached Mirkwood. However, Beorn did not fully trust the Dwarves, so Bilbo saw Beorn giving careful watch to see that his ponies were unharmed. When the company arrived at the Forest Gate the ponies were let go (to several of the Dwarves discontent) and Gandalf left the group as well, warning them, \"Do not stray off the path.\"[7]\nBilbo reaches the canopy of Mirkwood in The Hobbit films\nThe Company began to follow the Elf-path through the treacherous forest. Eventually the provisions ran low and the Company was forced to send Bilbo up a tree to see where the forest ended. Bilbo climbed up a tree, where a rewarding breeze of cool air and butterflies met him. Bilbo only saw more forest, so when he reluctantly climbed back down, he did not see that the forest ended. He reported his findings to the Dwarves, where they met the news with ill comfort, angry that they were fatter than Bilbo and so could not climb the trees to feel cool air or see the butterflies. Eventually the last provisions were eaten. The Company then came upon the Enchanted stream, of which they had been warned not to drink by Beorn. Bilbo saw a boat on the other side, leading the Dwarves to retrieve it. A deer came out of nowhere when all the Dwarves were on the other side. A Dwarf shot it where it died, on the other side. The Dwarves hoped for venison for dinner, when Bilbo realized that Bombur was drowning. The Dwarves fished him out to find he had been put to sleep by the stream's magic, but the boat was knocked away, ending the hope for venison.\nWhile wandering down the path, the Dwarves saw lights in the forest. Deciding that they would rather leave the path than starve to death they headed after the lights. As soon as they got to the lights, they went out and one of their party fell asleep. This happened twice. On the third time all of them fell asleep.\nWhen Bilbo awoke in the night, he was alone. He cursed the Dwarves for leaving the path and discovered that great spiders had captured his companions. Bilbo was forced to find his lost companions and cut through the cocoons the spiders had formed around his companions. He distracted the spiders by improvising several insulting songs to irritate them, and succeeded when the creatures left their domain to find the intruder and eat him. Bilbo killed a few by throwing stones at them and by stabbing them with Sting. The spiders never found him, since during this time Bilbo made use of the Ring to remain invisible. After freeing the Dwarves, he led them into a charge against the spiders, where the company killed dozens of the arachnids.[8]\nAfter traveling through Mirkwood the Dwarves were taken prisoner by Wood-elves, who believed that the company had \"assaulted\" the Elves while they were partying (the bright lights the company had seen in the forest). Bilbo avoided being caught by using the ring to stay invisible, and followed them into the Halls of Thranduil, the Elven-king, where they were held captive. Eventually Bilbo was able to rescue the Dwarves by stealing the chief of the guard's keys, and found a way for the company to escape the Woodland Realm by stowing away in a number of empty barrels, which periodically were taken by the Elves down the Forest River to Lake-town for trading purposes. The plan worked, and soon they all arrived at Lake-town, which they found to be a small town occupied by Men that Smaug would sometimes attack, though he had not been seen in many years.[9]\nBilbo hiding from Smaug, invisible, by Raoul Vitale\nThe captain of the guard in Lake-town took Bilbo and the Dwarves to the Great House to present the company to the Master and his councilors, and though the Master initially thought to imprison them in order to keep good relations with the wood-elves, he decided against it when the populace proved to be strongly in support of Thorin's company. Thus, Bilbo and the Dwarves spent several weeks in Lake-town as guests of honor, though Bilbo eventually caught a cold.[10]\nThe Lonely Mountain\nBefore long Thorin's company departed Lake-town, and crossing the river, followed Thr\u00f3r's Map to the location of the Side-door before the end of Durin's Day. Upon discovering the keyhole, the door was opened and Bilbo was sent in alone in order to scout ahead and perhaps to steal some treasure from Smaug.[11] When he arrived in the treasure chamber, however, Smaug was awake and sensed his presence, and so Bilbo put on the ring to avoid being seen.\nBilbo conversing with Smaug in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\nSmaug, though unable to see the hobbit, tried to figure out who or what the intruder was, but Bilbo refused to tell the dragon his true identity, answering Smaug's questions only in riddles. While invisible, Bilbo noticed that Smaug had a bare spot on his jewel-encrusted underbelly. Finally, Bilbo removed the ring and Smaug saw that he had stolen a cup, causing him to go into a terrible rage. After Bilbo made it out of Smaug's lair safely, he convinced Thorin and the other Dwarves to enter the side-door and close it behind them, which saved their lives when Smaug left the mountain, and flying to the side-door, scorched the surrounding area. Foiled, the dragon flew off to Lake-town with the intent to destroy it once and for all.[12] Bilbo afterwards relayed to the Dwarves what he had learned, but a thrush, hearing the information, flew to Lake-town and told Bard, a descendant of the Men of Dale, of Smaug's weakness. On Smaug's arrival, Bard shot the Black Arrow at the bare spot, killing Smaug and sending him to rot at the bottom of the lake, but destroying most of Lake-town.[13]\nThe Battle of Five Armies and aftermath\n\"There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and a song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\"\n\u2014The Hobbit, \"The Return Journey\"\nBilbo giving the Arkenstone to Thranduil in the films\nIn the meantime, Thorin and company had reclaimed the Lonely Mountain, though Bilbo, having found the Arkenstone that Thorin greatly desired, kept it secret from the Dwarf.[14] They were informed by Ro\u00e4c, an old raven of the mountain, of Smaug's death in Lake-town, but quickly the Dwarves' mirth was dampened by the news that the surviving Men of Lake-town and the Elven-king's army were marching to the mountain to reclaim their wealth. Thorin, suspicious of the armies, refused to make any deal, with them at their arrival, and barricaded the mountain, thus beginning a siege.[15] Bilbo, hoping to avoid conflict, took the Arkenstone to Bard and Thranduil, in order for them to barter their share of the treasure with. Despite Bard and the Elvenking's offers for the hobbit to stay with them for the time being, Bilbo decided to return to the mountain. To his surprise on leaving to return to Thorin's company, he found that Gandalf had returned, and found the wizard supported his decision. Bilbo then slipped back to the mountain, unnoticed by the Dwarves.[16]\nBilbo with dying Thorin, by Darrell Sweet\nThorin, on soon afterwards discovering Bilbo's perceived treachery, was furious and banished the hobbit from the mountain. Bilbo stayed with Gandalf and Bard for a short time, until Dwarves from the Iron Hills, led by D\u00e1in Ironfoot, arrived to aid Thorin's cause. However, shortly following this, a great army of goblins, led by Bolg, attacked, forcing the Dwarves, Elves, and Men to fight together to both defend the mountain and survive. This became known as the Battle of Five Armies, and though the goblins were defeated, Thorin and his nephews F\u00edli and K\u00edli were mortally wounded. Bilbo only witnessed part of the battle, as he was rendered unconscious early on, and wearing the ring, lay undiscovered until he came to following the battle's conclusion.[17] Beorn, chieftain of the Beornings, who had joined the fight, slew Bolg, scattered his bodyguard, and carried Thorin to safety. Bilbo, making his way to the tents of the wounded, found Thorin lying on a bed, in his last minutes of life. Thorin praised Bilbo and apologized to him for cursing him earlier, and thereafter passed away.\nAfter Thorin's funeral, the new king D\u00e1in II offered him his one-fourteenth share of the treasure, but Bilbo declined, receiving only two small chests, one with gold, and the other laden with silver. Bilbo traveled back with the wood-elf host that participated in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo traveled with the wood-elves down to Mirkwood, and then went to Beorn's house with Gandalf.[18] Then Bilbo set out with Gandalf to where Bert, Tom, and William had turned to stone. They dug up some of the buried treasure the Dwarves had buried earlier, most of which Bilbo offered to Gandalf to use to aid the peoples of Middle-earth. When they at last came to the borders of the Shire, the two parted, with Gandalf going his own way.\nReturn to the Shire\nBilbo finds his belongings being auctioned off.\nBilbo eventually made it back to Hobbiton, where he found an auction taking place at which his relatives, the Sackville-Bagginses, believing him dead, were selling most of his possessions to the other hobbits. The Sackville-Bagginses were vexed to see Bilbo alive, since they wanted to live in Bag End themselves. Bilbo had to buy back his sold possessions in order to avoid quarreling with the purchasers. After some years, Balin and Gandalf visited him, where they reported the current news of Middle-earth.[19]\nLater years\nReturning to Shire-life\nAlthough Bilbo returned safely to Bag End with his reward and lived in relative comfort, Bilbo\u2019s life was not quite the same as it had once been. His sudden return after having been thought dead lost him some of the neighbors\u2019 respect and he was later thought of as an oddity, and there were many talks and false rumors circulated about his affairs and doings. The worst of these problems came from the Sackville-Bagginses, who were angry that they were not able to possess Bag End when he was thought to be dead. This jealousy and anger increased when Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo (a Brandybuck on his mother's side) as his heir presumptive. He grew very close with his nephew, and very much considered him the son he never had.\nBilbo ignored these things said about him and avoided the Sackville-Bagginses as much as he could, even using the Ring once to hide from them. Bilbo was very generous with his money and most people were willing to forgive him for his oddities. He had many friends especially amongst the Gamgees whom he consulted frequently on landscaping and on the growing of vegetables. His good friend Hamfast Gamgee even allowed him to tutor his son Samwise Gamgee. Bilbo taught him to read and write, and at some point taught him various bits of poetry and told him tales of the elder days. Yet, he slowly began to become weary of his settled and sheltered life at Bag End.\nAnother adventure\nBilbo at the time of his 111th birthday party, in The Lord of the Rings films\nBilbo was the bearer of the One Ring for six decades, ignorant of its significance. However, by TA 3001, the Ring had begun to affect him. He did not appear to have aged at all, although he felt older and thin inside. He decided that he wanted to partake in one last adventure before he found a place to settle down and finish his account of the Quest for the Lonely Mountain.\nOn September 22, a Farewell Birthday Party was held in his honor, with even Gandalf returning for a visit. During the fesitivties, he is forced to hide from the Sackville-Bagginses once more with Frodo in tow, and secretly assures himself that Frodo will alright without him. Nearing the end of his party, he announced his intention to leave the Shire, to the shock of his family and friends, especially Frodo. Immediately afterward, he put on his Ring and disappeared, as a joke on his neighbors. He returned to his house where he was confronted by his friend Gandalf, who tried to persuade him to leave the Ring for Frodo. Bilbo initially agreed, but then became hostile and accused Gandalf of trying to steal the ring for his own benefit, which he referred to as his \"precious.\"\n\"Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so! But you won't get it. I won't give my Precious away, I tell you.\"\n\u2014Bilbo Baggins[20]\nBilbo gives up the Ring before leaving Bag End\nHorrified by Bilbo's outburst, Gandalf stood to his full height and ordered Bilbo to leave it behind. Immediately Bilbo returned to his senses, apologizing and admitting that the Ring had been troubling him lately. Gandalf then asks Bilbo to trust his old friend as he had all those years ago, and let the ring go. After a moment of inner struggle, Bilbo finally dropped the ring to the ground, becoming the first Ring-bearer to give up the ring of his own will. Bilbo and Gandalf bade each other goodbye, and Bilbo left the Shire for his journey.\nBilbo giving his mithril shirt to Frodo at Rivendell, by Mat\u011bj \u010cadil\nOn the same day, Bilbo left the One Ring and his home of Bag End in the possession of his relative, Frodo Baggins, who was eager to be his own master despite the loss of Bilbo, for he was not yet ready to leave the Shire. After his departure, Bilbo wandered to Rivendell and then, after a rest, accompanied some Dwarves to Dale and the Lonely Mountain, before returning to Rivendell.\nLife in Rivendell\nBetween TA 3003 and TA 3018, Bilbo worked on the written account of his adventures, in a book that would later be known as the Red Book of Westmarch. He also studied the Elvish language and compiled a three-volume history of the Elder Days, which he called Translations from the Elvish. He composed a poem for Aragorn as well as a much longer poem about E\u00e4rendil during his stay at Rivendell.[21]\nIn October 3018, Frodo arrived at Rivendell. Bilbo learned that his nephew was on a quest to destroy the One Ring and offered to take the Ring to Mordor himself at the Council of Elrond. His offer was politely declined due to his age, so Bilbo gave Frodo the sword Sting and for protection his Mithril Coat. However, he remained in Rivendell while Frodo traveled south. After Frodo returned, Bilbo had noticeably aged, partially freed from the Ring's effects, although he continued to desire it.\nLeaving Middle-earth\nBilbo shortly before departing Middle-earth, aged 131\nSince Bilbo had been a ring-bearer, he was allowed to accompany Frodo to the Undying Lands. On September 22, 3021, Bilbo turned 131 and became the oldest hobbit ever to have lived. On September 29, he, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, and Frodo boarded a ship docked at the Grey Havens and sailed away from Middle-earth, with Biblo exclaiming he was excited for yet another adventure. His fate afterward is not known but as he too was a mortal being, he most likely died in the light of the Blessed Realm of Valinor.[22]",

Fredegar, scared out of wits, had already run to the nearest house and raised the Horn-call of Buckland and so the Nazg\u00fbl left.[3]\nDuring Saruman's rule of the Shire he led a group of partisans fighting against the Ruffians around the Hills of Scary, before eventually being captured.

His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers F\u00edli and K\u00edli were the youngest of the thirteen \"by some fifty years,\" and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was \"the eldest left.\" F\u00edli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thr\u00e1in II.\nBombur, by TolmanCotton on DeviantArt\nJourney to the Lonely Mountain[]\nBombur was the twelfth Dwarf arriving at Bag End to attend the meeting arranged by Gandalf, where the quest to reclaim Erebor began. Because he was commonly considered to count for two Dwarves due to his girth, he was the last to arrive at Beorn's house and the last to cross the Enchanted stream in Mirkwood. Bombur tumbled with Bifur and Bofur onto Thorin when they first entered Bag End. He chose to stay and guard the camp and supplies while the others moved up the Lonely Mountain, because he trusted neither mountain paths nor ropes to stay intact under his weight. However, he was later forced to use the ropes to escape the rampaging dragon Smaug before he could be slain.\nBombur was often asleep during the Quest of Erebor. When he was violently knocked into the Enchanted stream by an aggressive stag, he fell under a spell which caused him to sleep for several days, burdening the others with his weight as they traveled. Later Bombur awoke up, but different. Bombur had forgotten their previous adventures during their journey, only remembering the feast in Bilbo's home. When his barrel was opened after the escape from the Elvenking's Halls, he was found to be asleep. Once they arrived at the Lonely Mountain, he was assigned a midnight watch and was asleep when Bilbo discovered the Side-door. After the death of Smaug, Bilbo promised to keep watch to allow Bombur to rest. He then snuck the Arkenstone out of the mountain and delivered it to the Elvenking and Bard the Bowman.\nHe fought and survived along with most of the company at the Battle of Five Armies. After the defeat of Smaug, Bombur received his share of the treasure and remained at the Lonely Mountain until the end of his days.\nLater years[]\nIn The Lord of the Rings, many years later while in Rivendell, Frodo Baggins learned from Gl\u00f3in that Bombur had grown so fat it that it now took several Dwarves simply to lift him from his couch to the dinner table. It is unknown if Bombur fought in the Battle of Dale during the War of the Ring.",

He, his brother, and two others were the only survivors of the unit that held the bridge until its destruction; they had to swim the River Anduin to reach safety.\nWar of the Ring[]\n\"Why should we not think that the Great Ring has come into our hands to serve us in the very hour of need? Wielding it the Free Lords of the Free may surely defeat the Enemy.\"\n\u2014The Fellowship of the Ring, \"The Council of Elrond\"     Boromir as depicted by Donato Giancola\nFollowing the battle, Boromir set out from Minas Tirith to Rivendell to decipher a riddle he had received (and his brother three times) in a dream:[2]\nSeek for the Sword that was broken,\nIn Imladris it dwells,\nThere shall be counsels taken,\nStronger than Morgul-spells.\nThere shall be shown a token,\nThat Doom is near at hand,\nFor Isildur's Bane shall waken,\nAnd the Halfling forth shall stand.\nBoromir departing Minas Tirith for Rivendell, by C.K. G\u00f6ksoy\nBoromir lost his horse in Tharbad and travelled the rest of the way on foot. The journey took 110 days.[2] He arrived at the beginning of the Council of Elrond where he described how Gondor was defending itself from Mordor and tried to convince them to give the One Ring to Gondor, where he felt it would be kept safe. But the council did not agree that the One Ring should go to Gondor, deciding that the only safe course was to destroy it.[2]\nBoromir joined the Fellowship of the Ring and was warned by Elrond not to blow the Great Horn until they were close to Gondor and in dire need.[2] On the voyage south Boromir advocated taking the Gap of Rohan, but was overruled as this lay too close to Isengard. He proved his worth as a capable warrior in Moria and assisted Aragorn in fighting off a large number of Orcs. After the loss of Gandalf and the Fellowship's departure from Moria, Boromir expressed opposition to Aragorn's decision to continue to Lothl\u00f3rien, arguing that to go south was better. He believed the stories told in Gondor that Galadriel's magic would harm them. He eventually agreed to go after Aragorn assured him the Elves would help them. In Lothl\u00f3rien, Boromir was disturbed by what he felt was Galadriel's testing of his mind, and he was suspicious of her motives.[3] Before leaving Lothl\u00f3rien he was given the gift of an Elven-cloak and a golden belt.[4]\nBoromir disliked the idea of destroying the One Ring, as he believed that it could be used to defeat Sauron once and for all, to save Gondor, and return it to its former glory; he tried to convince Frodo to give him the Ring. When Frodo refused, Boromir tried to take it by force but the hobbit put it on and fled.\nAfter Boromir realized his actions were caused by the corruption of the One Ring, he repented, and upon returning to camp he was confronted by Aragorn about Frodo. Boromir told Aragorn that he had seen Frodo an hour ago where he had tried to convince Frodo to bring the One Ring to Minas Tirith. They then had an argument and Frodo walked off. After the argument, Boromir went for a walk until eventually returning to the camp. The Fellowship, especially Aragorn, believed that there was more to the confrontation than Boromir was telling them, but Aragorn did not press the issue. Upon hearing of Frodo's predicament, the rest of the Fellowship, particularly the Hobbits, scattered in an ill-conceived attempt to find him. Aragorn ordered Boromir to follow and look after Merry and Pippin while he took off after Sam.[5]\nBoromir, near Parth Galen, facing Orcs while the Fellowship is scattered, by Nick Deligaris\nBoromir's body approaching the Falls of Rauros, by Roger Garland\nDuring the search, Merry and Pippin ran into a group of Uruk-hai, who tried to capture them. Boromir came to their aid and drove the Orcs off, but more Orcs came and Boromir was mortally wounded by many arrows. Aragorn found him dying under a tree, with Merry and Pippin gone. There Boromir confessed that he had attempted to take the ring from Frodo and expressed his remorse. Aragorn stayed with Boromir until he died from his wounds.[6]\n\n\"Farewell, Aragorn! Go to Minas Tirith and save my people! I have failed.\"\n\u2014The Two Towers, \"The Departure of Boromir\" (Boromir's final words, spoken to Aragorn)\nAragorn, Legolas, and Gimli laid his body inside one of the boats of L\u00f3rien, and sent him down the Falls of Rauros. Afterwards, they sang the Song of Boromir.\nLegacy[]\nThree days after Boromir's death, his brother Faramir saw his funeral boat passing down the Anduin. Men of Gondor found Boromir's Great Horn, broken in twain, and brought it to his father. This drove Denethor to despair, and when compounded with Faramir's later seemingly-mortal wounding and his knowledge of Mordor's indomitable might, he lost his mind. Many, including Faramir, often lamented Boromir's passing as Sauron readied his forces to attack, noting that his loss would be keenly felt by Gondor on the field of battle.\nBoromir, played by Sean Bean in the films, with the horn of Gondor\nBoromir won respect even from his enemies: in The Two Towers, Ugl\u00fak boasts that it had been the Uruk-hai who \"slew the mighty warrior\", a clear reference to Boromir.",

Second, the invasion left the ancient capital of Gondor, Osgiliath, in ruins. Last, the poisoned wounds received by Boromir shortened his lifespan, leaving him shrunken and in constant pain. Two years later Boromir succeeded his father as the Ruling Steward of Gondor in the year TA 2477.\nBoromir died in TA 2489 after a rule of twelve years. He was succeeded by his son Cirion.

This made him first cousin to Paladin's son Pippin, who was also his closest friend.\nWar of the Ring\nMerry was often considered the most perceptive and intelligent of the hobbits, for example, knowing of the One Ring and its power even before Frodo Baggins left the Shire. He guarded Bag End after Bilbo's party, protecting Frodo from the various and often unwanted guests. He also was the force behind \"the Conspiracy\" of Sam, Pippin, Fredegar Bolger and himself to help Frodo. Thus, even before the Quest of the Ring began, Merry was well prepared and organized; he assembled their gear and brought ponies. As a Brandybuck he also had a key to the gate in the High Hay. This shortcut through the Old Forest served them well, because they avoided the Black Riders and met Tom Bombadil, who helped them. At the Barrow-downs, Merry acquired his sword, a work of Westernesse.\nMerry with his good friend Pippin\nAt Bree, he was not present in the Prancing Pony when Frodo foolishly put on the Ring; but was outside taking a walk, and was nearly killed by the Nazg\u00fbl who arrived. At Rivendell, he was seen studying maps and plotting their path. His approval to the Fellowship came with only a little less reluctance than Pippin's; they were the two selected to relay news to the people of the Shire about Frodo's journey, but in the end Gandalf, believing in the friendship and loyalty shown to Frodo and Sam, requested that Elrond allow the two hobbits to come along. At Amon Hen he was captured along with Pippin by a band of Saruman's fighting\u00a0Uruk-hai, but he made a good account for himself, and Boromir valiantly defended him, though Boromir died in the attempt.\nMerry and Pippin in Fangorn Forest, by Raoul Vitale\nAfter being captured by the Uruks, Ugl\u00fak crudely tried to bandage Merry's head wound. Despite this, a scar would remain on Merry's head forever. The Uruks then gave to them an Orc drink, which would keep the Hobbit alive during the fast march towards Isengard. When they neared Fangorn Forest, Grishn\u00e1kh began searching them, attempting to find the One Ring, which he believed they carried. Before he was able to escape with the hobbits, \u00c9omer's \u00e9ored attacked and all of the Orcs, including Grishn\u00e1kh, were slain. During the confusion of the battle Merry and Pippin were able to escape into Fangorn Forest.\nEscaping with Pippin into Fangorn Forest, Treebeard and the newly risen Gandalf the White met him. Along with Pippin, he drank significant amounts of Ent-draught, which contributed to speedy gains in height and hair growth. Accompanying Treebeard to the Entmoot, and later to Isengard, he and Pippin were set as guardians following Saruman's fall. It was here that Merry encountered King Th\u00e9oden of Rohan, and was reunited with the remaining members of the Fellowship (save Frodo and Sam).\nSeparated from Pippin when Gandalf took the latter to Gondor, Merry swore fealty to Th\u00e9oden and became his squire. Without permission from his liege,[1] he rode to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the care of young Dernhelm (who, unbeknownst to Merry, was actually Th\u00e9oden's niece \u00c9owyn). When the Nazg\u00fbl attacked the Riders of Rohan and Th\u00e9oden was injured, Merry and \u00c9owyn faced the Witch-king of Angmar alone. Here, Merry's companion revealed herself to be \u00c9owyn. Battling both Fellbeast and the Nazg\u00fbl alone, \u00c9owyn was well assisted by Merry's crucial move: his sword, was one of the few weapons able to pierce the Ringwraith's form, but at a great expense to himself. He stabbed the Witch-king behind the knee as he was about to kill \u00c9owyn. This was enough to allow \u00c9owyn to finish off the Witch-king. Merry heard Th\u00e9oden's last words, but went unnoticed by the honor escort of Riders and was found wandering the city by Pippin. He was saved by the healing of Aragorn and recovered fully, leaving Minas Tirith to tend to the wounded Pippin at the Field of Cormallen.\nFor his bravery in battle, King \u00c9omer, as the new King of Rohan, knighted him and gave him the name of \"Holdwine\". During the Scouring of the Shire, he was in the forefront of the Battle of Bywater, using the Horn of Rohan presented to him by \u00c9owyn.[2]\n\nLater life\nUpon their return he and Pippin\u00a0both married. They were also the tallest of hobbits - Meriadoc being the slightly taller of the two - taller even than the legendary Bandobras \"Bullroarer\" Took,\u00a0due to their having drunk large amounts of Ent-draught. Merry married Estella Bolger some time after the end of the Third Age. He became the Master of Buckland in SR 1432 (FA 11), living at Brandy Hall and Crickhollow. He wrote Old Words and Names in the Shire. Although he was not recorded as having any children within the family trees, he had at least one son. At the age of 102, Merry returned to Rohan and Gondor with Pippin, dying there some time after the year FO 63. He was laid to rest in Gondor, and when Elessar died in FO 120, he and Pippin were entombed beside the great king.[3]",

He and his folk were the first of Mankind to encounter the \u00d1oldor of Beleriand when King Finrod Felagund happened upon their camp in Ossiriand in the year FA 310. After years of wandering westwards in search of the High Elves (or the Valar, of whom the B\u00eborians had heard rumor from the lesser Elves they had met in the east), B\u00ebor was eager to establish good relations with Finrod, and the two strove to understand each other. The language barrier was not a major problem due to the similarities between the tongue of the B\u00eborians, which had been influenced by the Elves they had met earlier, and the Sindarin tongue. In the tongue of his people, called Taliska, B\u00ebor was named 'Balan'. The name he is more commonly called by, B\u00ebor was actually the Taliska word for 'vassal', which he earned in the service of Felagund.[citation needed]\n\nB\u00ebor and his people settled first in Ossiriand but were at odds with the Green-elves that already dwelt there, for the men competed with the Elves for food and natural resources. Therefore, on the advice of Felagund, B\u00ebor led his people to Estolad, the encampment, in the realm of Amrod and Amras, sons of F\u00ebanor. There the people of the first house became more numerous and were enriched by the teachings of the Eldar. B\u00ebor, however, was not content and wanted to leave Estolad and enter instead into the service of King Finrod. He committed the rule of his people to Baran, his son, and departed with Finrod to his realm of Nargothrond. There B\u00ebor continued his service, and he returned never to Estolad. He died in the year 355 of the First Age at the age ninety-three, having spent 44 years in the service of Felagund. His death was greatly lamented by King Finrod and his people, who witnessed for the first time the Gift of Il\u00favatar: Death. But in the end B\u00ebor gave up his life willingly and died in peace, a thing previously unheard of by the Elves, who wondered much at the strange lives of Men.\nB\u00ebor was held among the Wise of the Edain and was revered by many among the Eldar. He laid the foundations for cooperation between the Eldar and the Edain in years to come and was the forefather of such heroic figures as Barahir, his son Beren Camlost, T\u00farin Turambar, Tuor his cousin, and E\u00e4rendil the Mariner (who was technically a half elf), son of Tuor.[1]",

        "biography": "His parents' names aren't known, but his grandfather was Calimehtar, the younger son of Gondor's King Calmacil. Castamir was not in line for the throne, but his royal background had made him the Lord of Ships under the previous king, Valacar. His lineage and influence left him in a position to challenge the new king, Eldacar, who was only half D\u00fanadan, and half Northmen. As King Valacar's only son, Eldacar was the legitimate heir to the throne, but his half Northmen lineage angered those who believed in a pure D\u00fanedain royalty. Capitalizing on these feelings, Castamir was able to incite rebellion and besiege Eldacar within the capital Osgiliath in TA 1437 of the Third Age. The city was set on fire by Castamir's troops, destroying the famed Dome of Stars. Shortly thereafter, Eldacar fled the city and went into exile in Rhovanion, to the north. With the defeat of the king, Castamir seized the throne.[2]\nFor ten years Castamir ruled Gondor with an iron fist, while Eldacar quietly regained support. Castamir ruled cruelly, and committed many foul deeds, including executing Eldacar's own son, Ornendil. At first the people of Gondor tolerated Castamir because of his pure N\u00famen\u00f3rean blood, but as Castamir proposed to move the royal seat to Pelargir and because of his many cruel acts, the people and cities of An\u00f3rien and Ithilien turned against him. So, in TA 1447, when Eldacar returned with an army from Rhovanion, the people of Gondor sided with him against the Usurper. Castamir was defeated at the Battle of the Crossings of Erui, the decisive battle of the Kin-strife as this period came to be known and was killed during the battle by Eldacar personally.\nCastamir's influence did not end there. Remnants of his forces, and his surviving sons, retreated from the battle to the port of Pelargir and after a year long siege, escaped by ship to Umbar, far to the south. These descendants of Castamir became the Corsairs of Umbar, fierce pirates who terrorized the coasts of Gondor with the help of the men of Harad. They were perhaps the greatest threat to Gondor for nearly 400 years, commanding massive fleets of ships. Their most infamous exploit was the Raid of Pelargir in TA 1634, in which a Corsair armada led by Castamir's great-grandsons Angamait\u00eb\u200e and Sangahyando\u200e sailed up the river Anduin to the port of Pelargir, deep in Gondor's territory. This raid coincided with King Minardil's visit, and he was slain by the Corsairs in the attack.\nCastamir's descendants remained a significant threat until TA 1810, when King Telumehtar of Gondor retook Umbar. In this battle the last descendants of Castamir were killed.[1][2]",

        "biography": "Origins[]\nCeleborn was a Prince of Doriath and a kinsman of Thingol, King of Doriath. Celeborn was said to be the grandson of Thingol's brother Elmo. Celeborn's father was Galadhon, and his brother was Galathil.[1]\nFirst Age[]\nHe fought in the First Battle, one of the first wars of the first age. Around FA 52 (FA as in First Age), Galadriel came to Doriath. Galadriel was one of the \u00d1oldor who came to Middle-earth wishing to see the lands and rule a realm of her own. She came with the second host of Elves from Aman with Fingolfin and Finrod.[note 2] In Doriath, she and Celeborn fell in love and married. Celeborn later fought in Dagor Aglareb, Siege of Angband, Dagor Bragollach, Assault on Doriath and N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad.\nA young Celeborn, by Sara Maria Morello\nWhen Thingol summoned the dwarves to add the Silmaril to the dwarves' necklace, the Nauglam\u00edr, the dwarves killed Thingol because of the disagreement between the dwarves and Thingol. But the elves killed all the dwarves except for the two dwarves. The two surviving dwarves went to Nogrod and gathered a large dwarf army to avenge the deaths of the dwarves. And they attacked Doriath. At the Battle in the Thousand Caves, Celeborn fights, but the dwarves win the battle and take the Silmaril and the Nauglamir. Later, one of the surviving elves goes to Beren and tells him what happened. Beren ambushes the dwarves with the green elves and the Ents. Celeborn fought in the Battle of Sarn Athrad too and the Elves won the war. The Silmaril was taken back from the Dwarves. Doriath was re-established and ruled by Dior, the son of Beren. Celeborn's distrust of the dwarves begins at this time. Then news of the Silmaril's presence in Doriath comes to the Sons of F\u00ebanor. Feanor's sons demand that the Silmaril be given to them. When Dior refuses, Feanor's sons attack Doriath. Celeborn fights in the Ruin of Doriath, but Feanor's sons win the war. But they cannot get the Silmaril back, for Dior's daughter Elwing flees to the Havens of Sirion with the Silmaril. Dior is killed and Doriath is destroyed. Celeborn flees to the Havens of Sirion. Learning that the Silmaril was in the Havens of Sirion this time, the sons of Feanor attacked the Havens of Sirion this time. Celeborn fought in the Third Kinslaying, but the sons of Feanor won the war. But they still could not capture the Silmaril, because Elwing threw herself into the sea with the Silmaril. After Celeborn fought in the War of Wrath and Beleriand was destroyed, Celeborn remained in Middle-earth with Galadriel.\n\nSecond Age[]\nCeleborn and Galadriel likely lived for a time in Lindon, a coastal region west of the Blue Mountains. Gil-galad was High King of the Elves who dwelt there. Many of the Elves in Harlindon, a part of Lindon south of the Gulf of Lune, were Sindarin Elves like Celeborn, and so he may have ruled a fiefdom there under Gil-galad.\nGaladriel and Celeborn together, by Anna Kulisz\nThen, early in the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel are said to have moved eastward into Eriador with a number of Elves in their following. They may have lived for a while near Lake Evendim. Their daughter Celebr\u00edan was born at around this time. They began to move eastward again around the year SA 700 because Galadriel sensed a growing evil in Middle-earth that she felt duty-bound to oppose.\nThe realm of Eregion was founded in SA 750, and Galadriel and Celeborn are said to have dwelt there for a time along with Celebrimbor and the Elven-smiths. The Elves of Eregion had dealings with the Dwarves of Khazad-d\u00fbm nearby, but Celeborn still distrusted Dwarves and would not enter Khazad-d\u00fbm, although the Dwarves there had nothing to do with the destruction of Doriath.\nThe Elves of Eregion also had contact with the Elves of Lothl\u00f3rien on the other side of the Misty Mountains. According to one story, Galadriel went to dwell in Lothl\u00f3rien around SA 1350 to SA 1400 while Celeborn remained in Eregion. However, in other versions of the story, both Galadriel and Celeborn stayed in Eregion.\nSauron came to Eregion in a fair disguise as Annatar the \"Lord of gifts\" in SA 1200, and deceived the Elven-smiths, who began forging the Rings of Power under his instruction in SA 1500. Sauron forged the One Ring to rule the others around SA 1600, and Celebrimbor hid from him the Three Elven Rings of Power that he had made, without Sauron's knowledge. Enraged, Sauron eventually attacked Eregion in SA 1697.\nCeleborn as depicted by Angus McBride for the Middle-earth Collectible Card Game (1995)\nCeleborn led a sortie from Eregion to meet the vanguard of Sauron's army. He was able to drive the enemy back long enough to join forces with Elrond, who brought reinforcements from Lindon. But Sauron's army was greater than their combined forces and Eregion soon fell. Celebrimbor was killed, and Sauron took the Nine Rings and at least six of the Seven rings. Sauron would eventually be driven back to Mordor in SA 1701 with the aid of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans.\nThe movements of Galadriel after the fall of Eregion are unclear. But Celeborn went to Rivendell to help strengthen elves defenses against Sauron. He fought in First Siege of Imladris, Battle of the Gwathl\u00f3 and War of the Last Alliance.\n\nThird Age[]\nCeleborn and Galadriel lived for a while in Rivendell, the home of Elrond. At some point, they may have travelled to the coastal region of Belfalas in the south to be near the sea.[citation needed]\nCeleborn and Galadriel's daughter Celebr\u00edan married Elrond in TA 109. Elrond and Celebr\u00edan had three children: twin sons Elladan and Elrohir, born in TA 130, and a daughter, Arwen, born in TA 241.\nAround TA 1050, the Necromancer, who was actually Sauron, built the stronghold of Dol Guldur across the Anduin from Lothl\u00f3rien. Celeborn and Galadriel are said to have returned to Lothl\u00f3rien to investigate the Necromancer and ensure the safety of Lothl\u00f3rien. But after a time, they once again departed, possibly for Rivendell. Lothl\u00f3rien remained under the rule of King Amroth.\nIn the war with Angmar Celeborn fought in the second siege of Imladris, the fall of Fornost, and the Battle of Fornost. Then a Balrog awoke in Khazad-d\u00fbm in TA 1980. Many of the Elves of Lothl\u00f3rien fled, including Amroth's lover Nimrodel. Amroth followed Nimrodel and he later perished at sea. Lothl\u00f3rien was left without a leader, so Celeborn and Galadriel returned there and became the Lord and Lady of Lothl\u00f3rien in TA 1981. They ruled the realm from Caras Galadhon, the City of the Trees.\nCelebr\u00edan was on her way to Lothl\u00f3rien to visit her parents in TA 2509 when she was captured by Orcs on the Pass of Caradhras. Her sons Elladan and Elrohir rescued her, but the horror of the experience remained with Celebr\u00edan and she decided to leave Middle-earth the next year to dwell in the Undying Lands.\nIn TA 2941, Sauron was driven out of Dol Guldur by the White Council - of which Galadriel was a member. However, Sauron had been prepared for the attack and returned to Mordor. He sent three Nazg\u00fbl led by Kham\u00fbl\u00a0to reoccupy Dol Guldur in TA 2951.\nAragorn came to Lothl\u00f3rien in TA 2980 and was betrothed to Arwen, who was there visiting her grandparents.\nCeleborn meets the Fellowship of the Ring, in the 2001 film\nWar of the Ring[]\nIn December of 3018, Elladan and Elrohir brought word to Celeborn and Galadriel of the Fellowship of the Ring's quest to destroy the One Ring. The Fellowship arrived in Lothl\u00f3rien on January 15, 3019, and was brought to Caras Galadhon to meet Celeborn and Galadriel on January 17.\nCeleborn at first welcomed Gimli despite his distrust of Dwarves and said he hoped that there could be friendship between their peoples once more. Then he\u00a0learned that the Balrog had been disturbed by an expedition of Dwarves to Khazad-d\u00fbm led by Balin several years before, and that the Balrog had attacked the Fellowship resulting in the loss of Gandalf the Grey. Celeborn was angry at first and regretted allowing the Fellowship to enter Lothl\u00f3rien, but Galadriel soothed him and he apologized to Gimli.[4]\nCeleborn promised to help the Fellowship however he could. On the eve of their departure from Lothl\u00f3rien, he discussed what route they might take, and offered them boats for their journey down the Great River Anduin. The next day, on February 16, Celeborn and Galadriel prepared a feast for the Fellowship and gave them gifts. Celeborn advised them further about navigating the Anduin.[5]\nLothl\u00f3rien was attacked thrice by forces from Dol Guldur during the War of the Ring: on March 11, 15, and 22. Each time, the Galadhrim led by Celeborn and Galadriel repelled them. After the destruction of the One Ring and Sauron's defeat, Celeborn and Galadriel crossed the Anduin and destroyed Dol Guldur. The shadow was lifted from Mirkwood.\nLater Third Age[]\nOn April 6, Celeborn met Thranduil, King of the Woodland Realm and father of Legolas, in Mirkwood. They renamed the forest the Wood of Greenleaves. Thranduil retained kingship of the northern part of the forest, while the center part was given to the Beornings and the Woodmen of Western Mirkwood. Celeborn claimed the southern part of the forest below the Narrows of the Forest to be part of Lothl\u00f3rien. This region was named East L\u00f3rien.\nCeleborn and Galadriel accompanied their granddaughter Arwen to Minas Tirith, where she wed Aragorn, now King of Gondor, on Mid-year's Day. Celeborn and Galadriel then travelled to Rohan and attended the funeral of King Th\u00e9oden. On the way home, they met with Treebeard at Isengard.\nWhen Celeborn and Galadriel parted from Aragorn, Celeborn said to his granddaughter's husband:\u00a0\"Kinsman, farewell! May your doom be other than mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!\"[6]\nCeleborn may have been anticipating the day when his own wife would depart for the Undying Lands while he remained in Middle-earth. On September 13, Celeborn and Galadriel crossed the Redhorn Pass to return to Lothl\u00f3rien.\nCeleborn, at Mithlond, ready to sail to the Undying Lands, as seen in The Return of the King film\nFourth Age[]\nGaladriel left Middle-earth to return to the Undying Lands in 3021 at the end of the Third Age. Celeborn remained in Lothl\u00f3rien, but after a few years he began to grow weary. He went to Rivendell to live with his grandsons Elladan and Elrohir for a while in the early part of the Fourth Age. Eventually, Celeborn went to the Grey Havens and sailed for the Undying Lands where his wife and daughter dwelled. It is said that \"with him went the last living memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.\"[7]",

After fighting in the Siege of Angband, Dagor Bragollach, Battle of the Pass of Aglond and Fall of Tol Sirion, he lived with his father and uncle in Nargothrond, staying even after Curufin's exile. After fighting in Nirnaeth Arnoediad, he fought in Sack of Nargothrond, and then escaped and traveled to Gondolin. He fought and survived the Fall of Gondolin and Third Kinslaying. Celebrimbor finally fought in the War of Wrath.  Unlike some of his kin, he remained in Middle-earth afterwards.\nSecond Age\nCelebrimbor settled in Eregion in the Second Age and started dealing with the Dwarves of the realm of Khazad-d\u00fbm. In SA 1500, Sauron, calling himself Annatar  (\"Lord of Gifts\"), befriended the \u00d1oldor of Eregion. He claimed to be an emissary of the Valar, especially Aul\u00eb, and instructed them in the art of ring-making.[4] Celebrimbor distrusted him, but the smiths of Eregion were deceived. Under the guidance and instruction of Sauron, the smiths openly made rings to learn the craft and Celebrimbor himself forged the three Elven rings without assistance from Sauron. But unbeknownst to him, the craft taught by Sauron incorporated a binding magic into the rings.\nCelebrimbor and Annatar forging the Rings\nIn secret, Sauron forged the One Ring, a master ring that would rule all the lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth via its influence over those who used the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on his finger, claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their bearers, the Elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor and the Elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings from him. The greatest of the rings (aside from the One Ring) were created by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron and thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to the One Ring. These were the three Rings of the Elves, the fairest of the Rings of Power. Celebrimbor named them Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after the principal Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water, respectively. He sent the three rings away for safekeeping: Vilya and Narya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel in L\u00f3rien. Celebrimbor also sent the mightiest of the seven to Durin III of Khazad-d\u00fbm.\nSauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, laying waste to the realm. Celebrimbor was captured in the chaos and was forced, under torture, to disclose the locations of the lesser rings, but he would not reveal the whereabouts of the three greatest of them that he had sent away for safekeeping. Celebrimbor died from his torment; his body was shot with arrows and hung upon a pole, and was later paraded as a banner when Sauron attacked the Grey Havens.[5] Celebrimbor was the last direct descendant of the line of F\u00ebanor, save perhaps for his father's brother Maglor, whose fate was unknown and was said by some legends to still wander the shores of the Sea. It was unknown whether he married, no children were recorded.\nCelebrimbor, by David Greset\nHowever, related to the House of F\u00ebanor were the Kings of Arnor and the Kings of Gondor, descendants of Celebrimbor's great-grandfather Finw\u00eb's union with his second wife Indis. Among them were not just E\u00e4rendil, but also Arwen and her husband Aragorn II, who helped bring about Sauron's final defeat in the War of the Ring.",

Celegorm and Curufin lost Himlad and fled south to the marches of Doriath. Not being welcome there due to the Kinslaying at Alqualond\u00eb, Celegorm, Curufin, and their people settled in Nargothrond.[7]\nWhile he and his brother lived in Nargothrond, they captured L\u00fathien Tin\u00faviel, daughter of King Thingol of Doriath.

Cirion repaired the forts guarding the Undeeps and prepared as best he could, but could not spare many men to defend this part of his realm, and in despair he sent several messengers to Gondor's old friends the \u00c9oth\u00e9od, a people now living in the Vales of Anduin to the far north.\nOnly one man, Borondir, reached the \u00c9oth\u00e9od capital of Framsburg, and delivered his message to Eorl the Young, their chieftain.\nAfter not receiving any answer for a full year, in TA 2510 Cirion set out west through An\u00f3rien, to prevent the Balchoth from crossing the Anduin at the Undeeps. However, the invaders swiftly overran the defences and crossed into the northern province of Calenardhon.\nThe army of Gondor was defeated and driven back across the river Limlight to the Field of Celebrant. In what was probably a coordinated attack, Orcs came out of the Misty Mountains, and assailed Gondor's flank from the west, driving them towards the Anduin. All hope was lost, when unlooked for came the riders of \u00c9oth\u00e9od out of the north. Together the \u00c9oth\u00e9od and the army of Gondor defeated the Balchoth and Orcs in the Battle of the Field of Celebrant, driving them into the great river.\nThe Oath of Cirion and Eorl, by artist Anke Eissmann\nCirion was a wise man, and saw that he could use the \u00c9oth\u00e9od further. He told Eorl that he would leave Calenardhon in his care, and meet Eorl again in three months' time. Back at Minas Tirith, Cirion ordered some of his most trusted servants to go to the Firien Wood in An\u00f3rien, and in secret clear the way to the summit of the hill of Amon Anwar.\nThree months later, Cirion, his son Hallas, the Prince of Dol Amroth, and two other councillors of Gondor set out for Calenardhon, and Cirion met with Eorl. They ascended Amon Anwar, and Cirion revealed the Tomb of Elendil, built in secret on this hill, as it formed the centre of the Gondor of old. At this secret place, he revealed his plan to give Calenardhon as a free gift to the \u00c9oth\u00e9od, so that there should be a perpetual friendship between the \u00c9oth\u00e9od and the people of Gondor. On the behalf of his people, Eorl accepted this deal, swearing the Oath of Eorl and becoming the first King of Rohan.[3]\nCirion, died in the year TA 2567, at the age of 118 years old.[1] He was succeeded by his son Hallas.",

Her early life is not well recorded but it is known that she and her family were\u00a0always close to the Gamgees, and her brothers frequently swam in the Bywater Pool as youths with the Gamgees including Sam.[3] Being very close friends with Sam, she expected that she and him would eventually marry, and expecting a marriage proposal soon she didn't like it when she heard Sam had left the Shire, apparently for Crickhollow. Though not pleased that he was away for a year, she waited for him patiently.[4]\nWar of the Ring[]\nRosie and her family were just as angry as most everyone else but remained docile due to having a family to look after. Rosie remained protected. When Sam came back on November 2, 3019, she told him that she had expected him by the spring and thought him dead. She eventually helped him and the other returning hobbits fight and defeat the Ruffians and Sharkey.

        "biography": "Curufin with his wife and his son, Celebrimbor in Valinor, by Marya Filatova\nCurufin was born in Valinor sometime during the Noontide of Valinor. There he married an unnamed Elf (most likely one of the \u00d1oldor) and had a son they named Celebrimbor, who would later follow Curufin to exile.[2] As with all the Elves of Aman, they lived in peace and prosperity until the release of Melkor, the murder of Finw\u00eb and the theft of the Silmarils that led to the Exile of the \u00d1oldor.[5]\nAs with the other Sons of F\u00ebanor, Curufin was bound by an oath to recover his father's Silmarils, which had been stolen by the Dark Lord Morgoth. His oath took him and his brothers to Middle-earth during the First Age.[5]\nArriving in Middle-earth, F\u00ebanor roused Curufin and others who were most obedient to him, and set the swan-ships aflame.  Later, Curufin and his brothers fought in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath but lost their father F\u00ebanor in a subsequent ambush.[6]\nCurufin and Celegorm, by Mathia Arkoniel\nCurufin and his older brother Celegorm (and possibly Celebrimbor) lived in Himlad, east of his brother Maedhros' fortress Himring and south of the Pass of Aglond between Himring and Dorthonion, leading into Doriath.[7] Around this time, their cousin Aredhel left Gondolin in search for both sons of F\u00ebanor. However, Curufin and Celegorm were not in their lands when she arrived, thus Aredhel left and traveled south and was lost in Nan Elmoth. Years later, Aredhel and her son Maeglin left Nan Elmoth, and E\u00f6l pursued them, only to be brought to Curufin. Though they had no love for him and scorned him, they did not slay him and allowed him to continue on his way.[8]\nThe two brothers fortified their realms with great strength and held them until the Dagor Bragollach. However, following the battle, the two brothers were defeated and had to flee with their people to Nargothrond, where Finrod welcomed them.[9]\nCurufin with his brother Celegorm in Nargothrond, by Jenny Dolfen\nShortly after, Beren also came to Nargothrond to remind Finrod of the oath he had sworn, and claim his help. Finrod decided to help Beren, but Celegorm and Curufin, remembering their Oath, persuaded the people of Nargothrond not to follow him, and not to wage open war against Morgoth, making them fearful. Finrod therefore had to leave with a handful of warriors, including Beren, and later died. His nephew Orodreth was left to rule in his stead, but real power rested with Celegorm and Curufin.[10][note 1]\nHe and his brother went hunting with Celegorm's hound Huan, then found L\u00fathien, daughter of Thingol, as she fled to find Beren. Feigning to help her, they took her captive and brought her to Nargothrond, for Celegorm had become enamoured and would have Thingol give him her hand. However, Huan helped L\u00fathien to flee, and they freed Beren and other thralls from Sauron. As these thralls returned, bearing news of the death of Finrod, the people of Nargothrond perceived the two brothers' treachery, and though Orodreth would not let them be slain, he cast them from Nargothrond.\nCurufin and Celegorm flee on horseback, as depicted by Alan Lee\nThe two brothers met L\u00fathien and Beren as they fled, and Curufin fought with Beren losing the knife Angrist in the struggle. Defeated, he had to flee with Celegorm, but sought to slay L\u00fathien even as he did, and shot Beren instead.[10]\nDue to Celegorm and Curufin's deeds, Thingol and Orodreth would lend no aid to Maedhros as he sought to unite Elves, Dwarves, and Men in what was called the Union of Maedhros.[11]\nCurufin fell in the Second Kinslaying, when the Sons of F\u00ebanor attacked Doriath to seize the Silmaril in the possession of the Elvish King Dior. His brothers Celegorm and Caranthir died with him during the assault.[12]",

        "biography": "First Age[]\nEarly history[]\nC\u00edrdan, born Now\u00eb, was kin of both Elw\u00eb and Olw\u00eb, lords in the host of the former.[1] C\u00edrdan was said to have been one of the most skilled Elves in building ships during the Great Journey, especially when the Elves dwelt by the Sea of Rh\u00fbn.[1] During the push westward, seeking to go to Valinor, Now\u00eb and his followers kept going where most of his kin fell away throughout the journey.  Despite Now\u00eb's great eagerness to see the light of Valinor (his \"greatest desire\"), he loyally searched for Elw\u00eb upon his disappearance.  Because of this, the Teleri missed the first trip on Tol Eress\u00eba to Valinor, on which went their kin, the \u00d1oldor and the Vanyar.  They took for their king Olw\u00eb, and while waiting for Ulmo to return for them, Now\u00eb led in learning the art of making and sailing ships, growing impatient. From this profession, he took the name \"C\u00edrdan\" which means \"shipwright\" in Sindarin. The Teleri also developed a great friendship with Oss\u00eb.  At the same time, although most of the Teleri had given up, C\u00edrdan sought Elw\u00eb longer and harder than most of his kin, partly because of his love for him and his allegiance.\nBecause of this, C\u00edrdan came to the shores too late during the second embarking of Eress\u00eba.  He came to the sands to find them departed, and as he stood forlorn he saw far-off a glimmer of light upon Eress\u00eba as it vanished into the West over Belegaer. Then he cried aloud: \"I will follow that light, alone if none will come with me, for the ship that I have been building is now almost ready.\"\nBut into his heart came a message from the Valar which warned him that his ship could not endure the voyage, nor would any ship for many years, until the time when his work be of utmost worth, remembered in song. C\u00edrdan answered in abeyance and saw a vision of a ship.\nC\u00edrdan, by David Greset\nFoundation and Return of the \u00d1oldor[]\nC\u00edrdan, therefore, remained with those Teleri who had chosen to stay east of the Sea for love of Oss\u00eb, and became their lord.  The folk became known as the Falathrim, \"people of the foaming shore\", and dwelt in the Falas by the sea.  There they built many ships, and the cities Eglarest and Brithombar, and found pearls which they sent to their overlord, King Thingol of Doriath, who was once Elw\u00eb.\nWhen Morgoth broke forth in the First Battle of Beleriand in YT 1497, C\u00edrdan was cut off and unable to come to Thingol\u2019s aid.  Further, although Thingol conquered with the help of the Laiquendi, the Falathrim were driven to the very edge of the sea, where they were besieged for some months, until the return of the \u00d1oldor when F\u00ebanor struck Morgoth from the north.  The siege of the Falas was abandoned as the Orcs were ordered northward to help their master, where they were all destroyed by Celegorm.  The Falas were saved.\nC\u00edrdan attended the Mereth Aderthad with many of his people, where he swore oaths of friendship with the \u00d1oldor, and quite possibly met and befriended his later neighbours and friends Turgon and Finrod.  Although Turgon eventually moved from Vinyamar to faraway Gondolin, C\u00edrdan\u2019s friendship with Finrod was lasting, and C\u00edrdan became a close advisor to the \u00d1oldor.  C\u00edrdan was, after all, a relative of his, being related (probably quite closely) to Olw\u00eb, Finrod\u2019s grandfather.\n\nEarly First Age[]\nWhen the tales began spreading (sown by Morgoth) of the Kinslaying of Alqualond\u00eb, C\u00edrdan, being very wise even at that time, was greatly troubled, feeling that these rumours sprouted from great malice.  Knowing the jealousy and dissension among the \u00d1oldor, he guessed that the malice was that of the kinslayers.  Therefore he dutifully sent messages to his overlord Thingol, telling him all that he had heard.  This resulted in the banishment of Quenya and greater strife between the Sindar and the \u00d1oldor.\nC\u00edrdan may have assisted in the Dagor Aglareb, but this is unknown.  He did not take part in the Dagor Bragollach, as he was far away and not directly attacked, if even he had time to come to the aid of his allies.  Nevertheless, C\u00edrdan made up for his lack of participation in the second assault on Hithlum, coming to the timely aid of Fingon when he was most needed.  They sailed up the Firth of Drengist, then struck the unsuspecting orcs from the west, giving victory to the Elves.\nC\u00edrdan in The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\nAfter the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, many fugitives came for shelter in the Falas.  The Falathrim mariners harassed the Orcs in guerilla attacks from the sea.  But it was only a matter of time before Morgoth attacked.  Then came the disastrous Fall of the Falas. Though both Brithombar and Eglarest were strong, with mighty walls, both fell one at a time due to the power of the Dark Lord's armies.  The Elves fought valiantly, but the walls were broken and most of the Falathrim killed or enslaved.  Barad Nimras was cast down, and the Falas laid to waste.  But C\u00edrdan and some of his followers escaped by sea, and he took with him Gil-galad, one of the last of the princes of the \u00d1oldor.  They came to the Isle of Balar and founded a new kingdom, but kept a foothold at the Mouths of Sirion, keeping ships hidden in the reeds there, making a refuge for all who fled thither.\nLord of Balar[]\nTurgon, receiving the dreadful news of the Havens fall, requested that C\u00edrdan send mariners to seek Valinor and the aid of the Valar.  C\u00edrdan built seven swift ships and sent them westward.  None returned, save for only one mariner of the Gondolindrim.  The way to the West was closed.\nEventually, C\u00edrdan served as messenger, when Ulmo delivered him a message for Orodreth, warning of the doom of Nargothrond, and ordering him to shut his gates and cast down the bridge.  The warning went unheeded, resulting in the Fall of Nargothrond.\nAfter news came to Balar of the Fall of Gondolin, Gil-galad was proclaimed High King of the \u00d1oldor.  C\u00edrdan soon after became a fast friend of the young half-elf E\u00e4rendil son of Tuor and Idril, who had grown up essentially under his shadow, and was apprenticed to him.  C\u00edrdan aided E\u00e4rendil in building the ship Vingilot, giving him advice and help.  C\u00edrdan doubtless remembered his vision, and this ship was indeed a fulfillment of it.\nC\u00edrdan and Gil-galad came with their armies from the Isle of Balar too late to prevent the disastrous Third Kinslaying when the Havens of Sirion were ambushed and many fell.  But E\u00e4rendil was not there, rather on a voyage, and the Silmaril of Beren and L\u00fathien had been spirited away by Elwing his wife.  Thus, wielding the Silmaril, E\u00e4rendil came to Valinor and found the forgiveness of the Valar. From that time on, C\u00edrdan was given foresight surpassing that of any of the Elves, perhaps some special grace of the Valar for his deeds in this world-changing episode (like the return of Glorfindel, who also contributed significantly).  After the War of Wrath, C\u00edrdan, heeding the bidding of the Valar long ago, once more obediently abstained from finding his heart\u2019s desire and going West, but with a small following remained in Middle-earth.\nSecond Age[]\nThe continents were shifted, but C\u00edrdan still took up his abode by the sea, at the Grey Havens, which the Elves built in the newly-formed Gulf of Lune whence the Eldar could sail the Straight Road, but most of them were unwilling at first to forsake the lands they fought in and preferred to linger there. There he welcomed the friendly and then-unfallen N\u00famen\u00f3reans, making friends with V\u00ebantur, chief of the mariners of Tar-Elendil, and later teaching Aldarion of ships (both management and construction) and port architecture, doubtless being the foremost authority on both.\nC\u00edrdan advised against the creation of the Rings of Power when Annatar came, but, like Galadriel, his counsel went unheeded in the midst of the joy and enthusiasm of the Eregion Elves, and especially Celebrimbor. Nevertheless, when the Three Rings escaped the Sack of Eregion, Celebrimbor had appointed him to inherit one of them. He received Narya, the Ring of Fire. Sauron, having revealed himself in the destruction of Eregion and empowered by the One Ring he had forged, invaded Eriador in the same blow; however, his attempt to take Mithlond and Lindon failed with the intervention of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans sent by Tar-Minastir.\nC\u00edrdan joined the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and fought as the lieutenant of Gil-galad. Many fell there, including Gil-galad and Elendil. After the battle, with Elrond, he urged Isildur, Elendil\u2019s first-born, to throw the captured One Ring into Orodruin, where it would be unmade, but Isildur refused.\nThird Age[]\nAfter the War of the Last Alliance and the death of Gil-galad, C\u00edrdan ruled over Lindon from the Grey Havens. For more than a thousand years they went undisturbed, but at around TA 1050, a shadow began to lengthen.  Though many deemed that Sauron was defeated forever, for the first time in many centuries some evil was stirring and awake.  It was at this time the Istari, sent by the Valar, came. He was the most foresighted of all of them, and alone knew the true purpose of the Istari. He also saw deep into the future of Gandalf, and gave him Narya, his greatest possession albeit one that he had seldom used.\nThroughout the war with Angmar, the Elves of Lindon under C\u00edrdan supported the D\u00fanedain of Arnor. With C\u00edrdan\u2019s help, King Araphor drove Angmar's armies from Fornost and the North Downs in TA 1409. Combining forces with Rivendell, and the Galadhrim who joined them from beyond the Misty Mountains, they subdued Angmar for some time.\nIn TA 1975, Elven sailors from Lindon brought a ship to Forochel to rescue the lost king Arvedui. The crew endured a perilous journey, but Arvedui rashly attempted to return that winter, and all aboard perished when the ship foundered. That year, C\u00edrdan and the Elves joined with the forces of Gondor and the remaining Northern D\u00fanedain in the victorious Battle of Fornost. Later, C\u00edrdan took control of the abandoned Elendil Stone in Elostirion on the Tower Hills, which could gaze into the lost west and was without a link to the other palant\u00edri.\nNothing more is mentioned of his actions until the War of the Ring in TA 3018 and later TA 3021. Galdor was his messenger to Rivendell and attended the Council of Elrond, speaking with authority on his lord\u2019s behalf.\nThe last mention of C\u00edrdan came with the end of the Third Age.  When the Ringbearers came to Mithlond, C\u00edrdan greeted them before the gates.  Although Gandalf, Galadriel, and Elrond passed west on the ship he had built for them, C\u00edrdan seems to have remained for a time.\nC\u00edrdan maintained the haven at least into the Fourth Age, but it was recognized that its purpose would eventually reach an end when no more Elves wished to cross the Sea. At that time, C\u00edrdan would abandon the Grey Havens and finally travel the Straight Road himself. After an unknown length of time in the Fourth Age, he sailed west aboard the last ship with the last High Elves, taking with him the last memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.",

        "biography": "Denethor was the third child and only son of Ecthelion II.[1] A proud and noble man, the blood of N\u00famenor ran truer in him than it had in any man of Gondor for many years. He was described as subtle and often scornful and could perceive the thoughts of men, including those that dwelled far off, similar to Faramir; but his son was oft moved to pity, whereas Denethor was filled with disdain. It was difficult to deceive him and dangerous to try.\nIn TA 2976, he married Finduilas of Dol Amroth, daughter of Prince Adrahil II of Dol Amroth.[5] Together, the couple had two sons, Boromir and Faramir. A few years later, in TA 2988, Finduilas died young, leaving Denethor embittered.[6]\nHe succeeded his father Ecthelion II as twenty-sixth Ruling Steward in TA 2984. During his stewardship,\u00a0Gandalf was less welcome in Minas Tirith, and his counsels went unheeded.\nWar of the Ring[]\nIn later life, Denethor secretly used a palant\u00edr to probe Sauron's strength, using it at the top of the White Tower in a secret chamber above the throne room.[7] The effort aged him prematurely, and although Sauron was not able to bend him to his will as he had Saruman, knowledge of the Dark Lord's overwhelming forces exacerbated the bitterness that had taken root at the time of the death of his wife.\nDenethor was well aware that Sauron's assault on Gondor would come during his lifetime and prepared accordingly, even though he increasingly came to believe that the struggle would be hopeless. In TA 3018 when Sauron attacked Osgiliath, he found the strength and preparedness of Denethor greater than he had expected or feared. Minas Tirith was fully provisioned for a siege and as war loomed Denethor sent away from the city the old, the women and children and had the beacons of Gondor lit, dispatching errand-riders with the Red Arrow to Th\u00e9oden of Rohan to summon aid.\nDenethor with his palant\u00edr in secret, by Anna Kulisz\nThe death of Boromir, his eldest and favorite son, and the siege and apparent doom of Gondor drove Denethor further along the path of despair. Following this news and the passage of Frodo Baggins through Ithilien he became estranged from Faramir, though Faramir still upheld his father's wishes.[5] Denethor therefore dispatched Faramir with reinforcements to command the garrison at Osgiliath and following the battle there and at the Causeway Forts, sent out a cavalry sortie under the command of Prince Imrahil to rescue his son's retreat. However, Faramir returned severely wounded, breaking Denethor's spirit.\nLooking into the palant\u00edr, Sauron was able to drive him mad with despair, giving him a hopeless vision of an approaching black fleet from the south, portending that Gondor would fall to Sauron thanks to the Corsairs of Umbar coming to assist in the Siege. Sauron, however, obscured the vision's finer details to hide that those ships would in fact be under the command of Gondor's erstwhile king, Aragorn, who ousted the Corsairs at Pelargir and come by ship to relieve the city. Denethor therefore believed that further resistance was futile, although he remained steadfast in his rejection of the shadow.\nHe committed suicide on March 15, TA 3019, having ordered his men to erect a pyre for him and Faramir in the Hallows of Minas Tirith. He threw a torch onto the pyre, then broke the white rod of his office over his knee and cast it into the flames, symbolizing the end of his stewardship and the rule of the Stewards. He laid himself down on the table and so perished, clasping the palant\u00edr in his hands. His attempt to take the grievously injured and apparently dying Faramir with him was thwarted by the timely intervention of\u00a0Beregond\u00a0and ultimately, by Gandalf.[3]\nDenethor II ruled as the Steward of Gondor for 35 years, from TA 2984 until his death in TA 3019. The title of Steward was passed to his son, Faramir, who also became the first of the Princes of Ithilien.[8] After his death the Anor-stone would only show Denethor's hands slowly withering in flame, unless the viewer had great strength of will to turn it to other visions.",

After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thr\u00e1in II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.\nLater in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thr\u00e1in when he left the Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thr\u00e1in was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.\nQuest of Erebor[]\nDwalin was the first Dwarf to arrive, alone, at Bag End when the unexpected party planned by Thorin and Gandalf began at Bilbo Baggins' hobbit hole. Wearing a dark-green hood and a golden belt, he walked into Bilbo's home as if expected, which greatly surprised Bilbo. Soon Balin arrived, and he and Dwalin sat talking while Bilbo kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more Dwarves. Later, when Bilbo griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Dwalin and Balin were the first (followed by F\u00edli and K\u00edli) to lend a hand. Later still, when the Dwarves filled Bag End with music, Dwalin played on a viol as big as himself.[1] Dwalin lent a green hood and cloak to Bilbo when they set out on their journey.\nGraham McTavish as Dwalin in The Hobbit films\nAfter Thorin's Company reclaimed the mountain from Smaug, Dwalin fought alongside his companions in the Battle of Five Armies. He survived the battle, and later received his fourteenth share of Smaug's hoard. He chose to live afterwards in Erebor under the rule of D\u00e1in II Ironfoot, Thorin's cousin and now King under the Mountain.\nLater life[]\nDwalin appears not to have joined his brother Balin's expedition to resettle Moria in TA 2989, meaning he was not among those who lost their lives there when the colony was overrun by Orcs five years later. He was one of seven of the ten Dwarves of Thorin's company who were still living in Erebor when Frodo came to Rivendell in TA 3018, as reported by Gl\u00f3in. After the War of the Ring was over, resulting in the defeat of Sauron and the destruction of the One Ring, Dwalin lived there throughout his life in the Fourth Age in Middle-earth and passed away in FO 91 at the great age of 340, considered later than any other known date of death for a member of Thorin and Company.[2][3]",

D\u00e1in alone looked past the gate into Moria, and had the wisdom to know that it was impossible for the Dwarves to return while Durin's Bane yet lived.\nD\u00e1in Ironfoot at the time of the Battle of Five Armies, by C.K. G\u00f6ksoy\nThe Battle of Five Armies[]\nD\u00e1in was the friend and cousin of Thorin II Oakenshield, and responded to Thorin's call for help during the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain.[3] D\u00e1in marched with five hundred Dwarven soldiers, exceptionally strong even by Dwarven standards, clad in heavy chainmail and iron boots, and armed with mattocks, shields, and swords. He arrived just in time for the Battle of Five Armies.[4] With Thorin's death in the battle, D\u00e1in became King of Durin's Folk and King under the Mountain, the first not of the main line. After the battle, D\u00e1in thanked the Great Eagles for their timely intervention, crowning their chief with gold and swearing the Dwarves to everlasting friendship with them. He also honored Thorin's commitments to Bard the Bowman and Bilbo Baggins, giving a fourteenth share of the Mountain's treasure to the people of Lake-town, and promising an even greater share to Bilbo, who politely declined to take more than two small chests, filled with silver and gold. D\u00e1in also granted the emeralds of Girion to King Thranduil, who prized them greatly.[5]\nThe War of the Ring[]\nD\u00e1in was a wise and just leader, and brought much wealth to the mountain realm and was on good terms with the Men of Dale to the south and the Elven king of Northern Mirkwood as well, which ensured peace for many years to come. When Balin and other Dwarves decided to reclaim Moria,\u00a0D\u00e1in initially refused, but Balin insisted on going.[6]\n\nA few months before the Council of Elrond, a messenger from Mordor appeared at the entrance of the Lonely Mountain and offered the Dwarves an alliance with Sauron, asking only in return that the Dwarves share what they knew \"concerning Hobbits\", and help to track down the One Ring, which the messenger described as \"least of rings... a trifle that Sauron fancies.\" \u00a0The messenger said that, if the Dwarves could deliver the Ring itself, then Sauron would return three of the Rings of Power that originally belonged to the Dwarf-Lords, and Moria would be theirs to possess forever. \u00a0On the other hand, the messenger warned that \"things will not seem so well\" if the Dwarves did not help.[6]\nD\u00e1in becoming King under the Mountain\nKnowing from long and bitter experience that Sauron could not be trusted, D\u00e1in refused to be bribed or blackmailed, and sent the messenger away without an answer by claiming that he needed time to think over the proposal. He instead sent Gl\u00f3in to Rivendell to consult with Elrond, while D\u00e1in prepared the Lonely Mountain for war.[6]\nD\u00e1in and Brand preparing for battle\nDeath[]\nD\u00e1in participated in the War of the Ring's northern campaign but was killed during the Battle of Dale in TA 3019, defending the body of King Brand of Dale before the gates of the Lonely Mountain. He was, by then, an extremely old Dwarf, at the age of two-hundred and fifty-two, but still strong for his age. He was still among the greatest of the Dwarven warriors, a direct descendant of Durin I and his prowess in battle was nearly unmatched.\nD\u00e1in II Ironfoot perishes trying to save the body of King Brand\nAfter news of his death reached Minas Tirith, Gandalf\u00a0remarked that, as saddened as they must be at D\u00e1in's death, they should be glad that he died in battle, defending his friend's body, as well as amazed that he was still as formidable a warrior as he had been when he was a young dwarf:\n\"I should call that a heavy loss, if it was not a wonder rather that in his great age he could still wield his axe as mightily as they say he did, standing over the body of King Brand before the gate of Erebor, until the darkness fell.\"\nAfter his death during the war, his son, Thorin III Stonehelm, succeeded him.[1]",

On Sm\u00e9agol's birthday in TA 2463 they went fishing (or rather D\u00e9agol fished while Sm\u00e9agol dug in the earth), and a big fish pulled D\u00e9agol underwater. It was then that he discovered the One Ring, half-buried in the river-bed. When Sm\u00e9agol saw the Ring, he stared at it with great desire, and then asked to keep it for his birthday. When his cousin refused, Sm\u00e9agol became enraged and strangled D\u00e9agol to death, hiding the body, which was never found. This deed haunted Gollum for the rest of his life.\nOf the Ring's bearers, D\u00e9agol carried it for the shortest collective time, possessing it only for no more than a few minutes. By contrast, the next shortest,\u00a0Samwise Gamgee, carried it for a full day, and all the other Ring-bearers held it for at least a year. D\u00e9agol was also the only Ring-bearer never to use the Ring, all the others making use of its gift of invisibility at least once.\nIt was possible that the Ring had already affected D\u00e9agol in a way that made him desire to keep it, explaining his unwillingness to give it to Sm\u00e9agol.[1]",

While dwelling there, he sought after for \"all the tidings and lore\" of the House of Hador from the remnants of the peoples of Hithlum, Dor-l\u00f3min, Nargothrond, Doriath, Gondolin, East Beleriand, and the many other lands of Beleriand because he found that \"the glory and sorrow of that House was nearest to his heart\".[3] In particular, he learned of \"the matter of M\u00eem and his later dealings with H\u00farin\", though a lot of the lore that he had learned was from Mablung.[4] However, despite \"the little that was remembered among the people of Nargothrond\" of what Gwindor or T\u00farin himself ever revealed to them, D\u00edrhaval was unable to find out more about the whereabouts of T\u00farin between his flight from the Kingdom of Doriath and his arrival at Nargothrond.[4] Yet, through much fortune, D\u00edrhaval encountered a very old man named Andv\u00edr, who was once a part of the very same outlaw-band that T\u00farin had once led; it was from Andv\u00edr that D\u00edrhaval learned many of the gaps in T\u00farin's life, and more fully understood the encounter between M\u00eem and H\u00farin in Nargothrond.[3][4]\nHe compiled all of the lore that he had gathered and wrote a very long narn in the alliterative Minlamad thent/estent,[4] telling of the tragedy of Morgoth's curse on H\u00farin's children: T\u00farin and Ni\u00ebnor. This lay, the Narn i Ch\u00een H\u00farin, was highly praised by the Eldar since it was in the Grey-elven tongue. It is the only full account on T\u00farin's life, and all later writings on the subject fall back on this one.[3]\nD\u00edrhaval did not write any other poems or lays, as the Silmaril captured by Beren and L\u00fathien was in the keeping of Elwing: soon the Sons of F\u00ebanor launched an attack on the exiles in the Havens of Sirion to claim it. D\u00edrhaval was said to be one of those who fell during the Third Kinslaying.[3][5]",

Thorongil also advised Ecthelion to listen to the counsels of Gandalf as opposed to those of Saruman, which Ecthelion did willingly.

His reign saw rebellion escalate into full scale civil war, for the nobility of Gondor were not prepared to accept a king with only half D\u00fanedain heritage. After ascending the throne in TA 1432 the civil war of the Kin-strife broke out. Eldacar reigned for five years until he was besieged in Osgiliath, being forced to flee into exile in Rhovanion by his far relative Castamir the Usurper, who reigned for ten bloody years, beginning with the execution of Eldacar's eldest son, Ornendil. While in exile, Eldacar slowly gathered support from the Northmen and the D\u00fanedain from the northern parts of Gondor. Castamir's tyrannical rule turned the people of the inland provinces against him and Eldacar saw his chance.\nIn TA 1447, he marched south with an army from the Rhovanion and was joined by many from the cities and northern provinces of Gondor. The armies of Eldacar and Castamir clashed at the exceptionally bloody Battle of the Crossings of Erui, where many of the high nobility of Gondor perished, but Eldacar was victorious, personally killing Castamir. Eldacar then besieged Pelargir where Castamir's sons put up the last resistance. Eldacar had no ships at his disposal (for Castamir was the Lord of Ships of Gondor) and Castamir's sons finally fled by sea to Umbar, allying with Haradrim to make war on Gondor.\nEldacar reigned until TA 1490 and was succeeded by his second son Aldamir.[1][2]",

For this Sauron hated Amandil, and by extension Elendil, the most out of all the N\u00famen\u00f3reans.[3] He was married to an unnamed N\u00famen\u00f3rean woman no doubt of the same upbringing and noble blood to which they had two sons: Isildur and An\u00e1rion. It is not known whether she followed him to Middle-earth after the Downfall of N\u00famenor.[3]\nWhen Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n and Sauron were preparing their assault on Valinor, Amandil told him to gather the Faithful in R\u00f3menna and escape to Middle-earth. Elendil did as his father bade, and gathered the Faithful and their wives and children in 9 ships, and waited just off the coast.[3] With them, they took the palant\u00edri, the \"Seeing Stones\" that were given to the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb by the Elves of Tol Eress\u00eba, and a seedling of Nimloth, the White Tree of N\u00famenor.\nWhen the Downfall came, the great wave that devoured N\u00famenor was coming towards R\u00f3menna when a great storm came out of the West, snapping the sails of his ships and tossing them around in giant waves, and carried him all the way to Middle-earth.[3] With the Downfall, Elendil and his children became the sole surviving descendants of the House of Elros.\nElendil with his men during the Last Alliance, as seen in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)\nFounder of Arnor and Gondor[]\nElendil's four ships were separated from those of his sons and arrived in Eriador. As he landed Elendil proclaimed in Quenya: Et E\u00e4rello Endorenna ut\u00falien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta - \"Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.\" His heir and 38th-great-grandson Aragorn spoke these traditional words again when he took up the Crown of Gondor at the beginning of the Fourth Age.\nElendil was welcomed to Eriador by the Elven-king Gil-galad and in SA 3320 he founded the Kingdom of Arnor, building the city of Ann\u00faminas as his capital. The five ships carrying Elendil's sons landed further south, where An\u00e1rion founded the city of Minas Anor in An\u00f3rien, and his son Isildur founded Minas Ithil in Ithilien. They ruled the new realm of Gondor jointly as its Kings from their capital city of Osgiliath. Across the realms towers were built for the palant\u00edri, with which the two kingdoms kept contact.[4]\nLast Alliance of Elves and Men[]\nElendil (front) fighting Sauron with Gil-galad on Orodruin's slopes, by Kip Rasmussen\nIsildur taking the One Ring, after his father and Gil-galad are slain - by Ralph Damiani\nIn time Sauron returned to Mordor and began to rebuild his power. In SA 3429, he attacked seizing Minas Ithil. Isildur went north to take counsel with his father, leaving An\u00e1rion in charge of the defence of Gondor. In SA 3434, Elendil and Isildur returned south together with the Elven High King Gil-galad and their combined armies, in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.\nAfter defeating Sauron's armies and advancing into Mordor itself, the armies of Elves and Men settled into a siege of the main tower of Sauron: Barad-d\u00fbr. During this siege An\u00e1rion was killed.\nAfter seven years of siege, in SA 3441 Sauron came out to personally do battle with his enemies. Elendil, together with Gil-galad, overthrew Sauron, but they were both killed in the process, and Elendil's sword broke when he fell.[5]\nIsildur used his father's broken sword to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Vanquished, Sauron's spirit fled. Isildur built a hidden tomb for his father on the summit of the hill of Amon Anwar,[4][6] the midpoint of Gondor. Later, with the creation of the Kingdom of Rohan, the Steward Cirion had Elendil's casket moved to Rath D\u00ednen in Minas Tirith.\nElendil's dying body is held by his son, Isildur\nLegacy[]\nLeading the remnant of the Faithful N\u00famen\u00f3reans to Middle-earth, Elendil established strong regimes there and created the great alliance that put an end to Sauron's power for over a thousand years. His bloodline and spirited leadership survived in the D\u00fanedain of the North and South of Middle-earth, that would in turn sire the brave and heroic Men that would help bring a final end to Sauron in the War of the Ring.[7][8]\nAragorn's battle-cry in the The Lord of the Rings was \"Elendil!\".\nThe Oath of Elendil[]\nIn Quenya:Et E\u00e4relloEndorenna ut\u00falienSinome Maruvanar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-Metta\nTranslation:Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come.In this place I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.'\"\nThis oath was sung an age later by Aragorn II Elessar, during his coronation at the end of the War of the Ring.",

Although she was physically healed by Elrond, after fear and torment from the Orcs she lost all joy from Middle-earth, and so she departed for the Undying Lands the next year. Due to this, the twins harbored great hatred for Orcs.[3]\nBy the year TA 2933, Elladan and Elrohir went riding against Orcs with Arathorn II, the father of Aragorn II Elessar. There Arathorn was slain and his wife and son went to dwell in Imladris, where Elrond received Aragorn as his foster-son, naming him Estel.[4]\nWar of the Ring[]\nWhen the Fellowship of the Ring formed in Rivendell, the twins' role was to scout the lands and prepare the way for the Fellowship.[5] Later, they traveled along with Halbarad and the Grey Company.

        "biography": "Maglor raising Elrond, by Tuuliky\nFirst Age\nElrond Peredhel was the son of E\u00e4rendil and Elwing, and great-grandson of L\u00fathien. He was born in the refuge of the Havens of Sirion in Beleriand late in the First Age, soon before its sack by the Sons of F\u00ebanor. Elrond and his twin brother Elros were captured and raised by Maglor, a son of F\u00ebanor. Though at first there was no great love between them, eventually Maglor took pity on them and cherished them, and eventually grew to love them.[3] By the end of the First Age and the War of Wrath, the Sons of F\u00ebanor were again working alone, suggesting that by this time, Elrond and Elros had left their nominal captivity and traveled to Lindon.\nSecond Age\nElrond and Elros were given the choice at the end of the First Age to be counted among Men or Elves. Elros chose the Fate of Men and became Elros Tar-Minyatur, the first King of N\u00famenor. Elrond Half-elven chose to be counted among the Elves,[4] and remained in Lindon as captain and herald of Gil-galad, the High King of the \u00d1oldor.[5]\nWith the start of the War of the Elves and Sauron in SA 1695, Elrond was sent to Eregion by Gil-galad in an attempt to protect it from the invading forces of Sauron. Unfortunately, Elrond's host arrived too late and was not large enough on its own to defeat Sauron's army. He retreated north with the refugees of Eregion, including Celeborn, only escaping because the forces of Durin III assailed Sauron's army in the rear. It was during the following two years (SA 1697) that Elrond founded Rivendell at the feet of the Misty Mountains, as a sanctuary and stronghold. For the next four years, Rivendell was besieged by Sauron's forces.\nWith the arrival of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans, the army besieging Rivendell was caught between the forces of Gil-galad and Elrond and destroyed. Elrond remained in Rivendell and hosted the first White Council, attended by Galadriel, at which it was decided that Elrond's home, the Last Homely House, would remain the last stronghold west of the Misty Mountains, and that the Three Rings then held by Gil-galad and Galadriel would remain hidden. According to one account Gil-galad at this time gave Elrond Vilya the Blue Ring, though in other accounts Gil-galad kept both Narya and Vilya until the end of the Second Age. It was also here that Elrond first met Celebr\u00edan, the daughter of Celeborn and Galadriel.\nElrond in battle during the War of the Last Alliance, as portrayed in the films\nNear the end of the Second Age, Elrond rode beside Gil-galad in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, which set out from Rivendell to Mordor in SA 3431. Elrond was Gil-galad's herald during the war against Sauron. The Alliance, which also included Elves from Lothl\u00f3rien, Men from Arnor and Gondor, and Dwarves likely led by Durin IV, defeated Sauron's army at the Battle of Dagorlad and laid siege to Barad-d\u00fbr for seven years. Eventually, Sauron himself was defeated by Elendil and Gil-galad, allowing Isildur to cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger and claim it for himself.\nThe war took a toll on the forces of both Elves and Men. Gil-galad, Elendil, and his younger son An\u00e1rion were killed in the siege. Elrond and C\u00edrdan only remained as the commanders of the Elves, and Isildur as High King of the Realms in Exile. Upon discovering that Isildur had claimed the One Ring for himself, Elrond urged Isildur to throw the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, but the seduction of the Ring made Isildur refuse. Isildur claimed the Ring as a weregild for his father and brother, and Elrond (perhaps not fully understanding the nature of the One Ring) acknowledged his claim. Elrond then returned to Rivendell at the end of the war.[6]\nThird Age\nElrond riding out of Rivendell, by Robert Zigo\nIn the year TA 109, Elrond wedded Celebr\u00edan. In the year TA 130, the twins Elladan and Elrohir were born, and in TA 241 a daughter, Arwen Und\u00f3miel. Elrond lost Celebr\u00edan in TA 2510 when she was waylaid by Orcs crossing the Misty Mountains and, unable to recover, took a ship to the Undying Lands.[7][8]\nIn the later years, he was instrumental in harboring the heirs of Isildur while the line lasted, the most famous of these sons of men was Aragorn II, whom he took in and fostered as his own after his father Arathorn II died in TA 2933. Elrond, foreseeing the boy's difficult future gave him the name Estel, Sindarin for hope. Aragorn grew up in Imladris unaware of his royal lineage until Elrond told him when he had reached his manhood.[9]\nHe also was a member of the White Council, which was often held in Rivendell, and was a great friend of Gandalf the Grey. He helped Thorin II's expedition to retake the Lonely Mountain by discovering and translating the Moon Writing on Thorin's map.[10]\nUpon learning that Aragorn and Arwen had become betrothed in TA 2980, Elrond was sorrowful, knowing that his daughter had made a choice to become mortal and therefore decreed that for such a price she could marry no less a man than the King of Arnor and Gondor.\nAfter Frodo's departure from the Shire with the One Ring, Elrond sent out riders to help guide him back to Rivendell. One of these, Glorfindel, successfully found Frodo and helped him reach Rivendell.[11] On October 25, 3018 he held the Council at which it was decided to attempt to destroy the One Ring. He appeared to have selected the members of the Fellowship other than Frodo and Sam.[12]\nFive months later, Elrond sent his sons Elladan and Elrohir with the Rangers of the North to Rohan. Through his sons, Elrond advised Aragorn to take the Paths of the Dead.[13]\nElrond before departing Middle-earth\nElrond remained in Rivendell until the destruction of the One Ring and of Sauron, after which he went to Minas Tirith to surrender the Sceptre of Ann\u00faminas to King Elessar and give his daughter Arwen Und\u00f3miel away to be married.[14] On September 29, 3021, Elrond left Middle-earth to go over the sea with the other Ring-bearers, never to return.[15]",

Emeldir was charged to lead the women and children of B\u00ebor's folk who had to flee from their homes after the Dagor Bragollach since their land was now taken and ruled by Sauron, Morgoth's commander. Though she would have preferred to defend her husband and son, Emeldir was successful in bringing her charges safely to Brethil where the Haladin (who were also of the Edain) dwelt. It was because of doing all this that she gained the title Man-hearted.[3]\nHer only grandchild and grandson was the Half-elf Dior, who later became the King of Doriath, and her great-grandchildren were the twins Elur\u00e9d and Elur\u00edn, and their younger sister Elwing.",

        "biography": "\u00c9omer, born in TA 2991, of the House of Eorl, was the son of \u00c9omund, the Lord of Aldburg and descendant of \u00c9ofor, and of Th\u00e9odwyn, sister of King Th\u00e9oden. In TA 3002, when \u00c9omer was eleven, \u00c9omund was slain in battle with Orcs. Th\u00e9odwyn died of grief shortly afterward. \u00c9omund also had a daughter named \u00c9owyn, \u00c9omer's sister. After they were orphaned Th\u00e9oden adopted them as his own children.\n\u00c9omer became the third Marshal of the Mark, and was a strong leader of Men. He was honored highly and trusted by the King, and was close with his cousin Th\u00e9odred, son of Th\u00e9oden who loved him like a brother.\nHis \u00e9ored hunted down the Uruk-hai that had taken Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took as they camped near Fangorn Forest, slaying them all. He never saw the Hobbits, as they had fled during the battle. Afterwards he met Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas on the plains of Rohan, and he lent them two horses, Arod and Hasufel.\n\u00c9omer returned to Edoras and reported meeting the Ranger and his friends and allowing them to go free, a violation of the King's law. Under the poisonous advice of Gr\u00edma Wormtongue, he was imprisoned by Th\u00e9oden, who had grown weak, aged, and suspicious under Saruman the White's influence.\nDepiction of \u00caomer at Helm's Deep by Angelo Montanini\nAfter Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas reunited with Gandalf, the four hastened to Edoras, where Gandalf broke Saruman's influence over Th\u00e9oden and restored him to health and vitality. Th\u00e9oden freed \u00c9omer, who offered his sword to Th\u00e9oden in token of his loyalty. Th\u00e9oden named \u00c9omer his heir prior to riding away from Edoras to the defense of the Hornburg.\nAt the Battle of the Hornburg, \u00c9omer was involved in was the defence of the gate where he, Aragorn, and a small band of men left through a back door at the side of the Hornburg and led an assault on the forces attempting to break the gates of the Hornburg. After this attack \u00c9omer and Aragorn attempted to return through the door when \u00c9omer was jumped upon by several Orcs who had laid low during the assault, though \u00c9omer was saved by Gimli, who had secretly followed him out to the gate. When the Deeping Wall was breached, \u00c9omer and Gimli were unable to reach the fortress and instead retreated up Helm's Deep to the Glittering Caves, where they held the Orcs at bay.\n\u00c9omer during the red dawn, by Fabio Leone\nAfterwards he rode with Th\u00e9oden, Aragorn, and Gandalf to Isengard, where they were greeted by Merry and Pippin, who were celebrating their recent victory. Treebeard and his fellow Ents remained as well in order to guard the now imprisoned Saruman and Wormtongue.\nAfter this, \u00c9omer rode with Th\u00e9oden to Dunharrow, where the Rohirrim were mustering. After receiving the Red Arrow, Th\u00e9oden agreed to gather a force to help defend the city of Minas Tirith against the impending assault by Mordor. Th\u00e9oden and \u00c9omer rallied ten thousand men, leaving four thousand behind to guard Rohan before riding to the White City. The army of Rohan managed to arrive at the Pelennor Fields just as Minas Tirith's Great Gate was breached. In the ensuing Battle of the Pelennor Fields \u00c9omer fought gallantly, slaying many foes. But Th\u00e9oden was fatally crushed by his horse, Snowmane, after being attacked by the Witch-king's fellbeast. Coming upon their corpses, \u00c9omer was driven to temporary madness at seeing \u00c9owyn, his sister, among the King's retinue, apparently dead, and charged in renewed fury at the forces of Mordor. He and Aragorn later met on the battlefield and reaffirmed their loyalty to each other, before returning to the long, grim work of winning the battle.\nIn the battle's aftermath, \u00c9omer attended to \u00c9owyn in the Houses of Healing, and, with Aragorn and Meriadoc Brandybuck, helped call his sister back to consciousness. Aragorn said that, as broken as Eowyn's heart had been over her unrequited love for Aragorn, her love for her brother was much more real to her, and a much more potent reason for her to live.\n\n\u00c9omer became King of the Mark upon Th\u00e9oden's death, and attended the final council of war before the Battle of the Black Gate, where Gandalf counseled that the combined forces of Gondor and Rohan must throw a diversionary force of sufficient size against Mordor, with little chance of survival, let alone success, in the slender hope of distracting Sauron long enough to allow Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee to cross Mordor in secret and deliver the One Ring to Mount Doom.  \u00c9omer confessed that he had little understanding of the \"deep matters\" being discussed, but he did not need it.  For him it was enough that Aragorn and his allies had come to Rohan's aid at Helm's Deep, and therefore, Rohan would stand with Gondor in the last battle. Some riders under the command of Elfhelm remained in Minas Tirith as part of the garrison.\nFollowing Sauron's fall, \u00c9omer and his men went back to Edoras to attend to affairs of the kingdom, returning later to bear the body of Th\u00e9oden back to his home for burial, where \u00c9omer was formally crowned as King.\nKing \u00c9omer at Aragorn's coronation in the films\n\u00c9omer renewed the Oath of Eorl with Aragorn after the latter had been crowned King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom, swearing everlasting friendship between Rohan and Gondor (and legalizing Cirion's grant of Calenardhon to the \u00c9oth\u00e9od.)\nHe became known as \u00c9omer \u00c9adig, or \"the Blessed\", because during his reign Rohan recovered from the hurts of the War and became a rich and fruitful land again.  Although Sauron was defeated, the West was never wholly free of enemies, and Elessar and \u00c9omer rode together to war many times.\n\u00c9omer had met Loth\u00edriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth during his stay in Gondor, and they were wed. She bore him a son Elfwine, who succeeded his father, after \u00c9omer's death in the year FO 63.",

        "biography": "Depiction of Eorl on a tapestry in the films\nEorl was born in TA 2485. His father was L\u00e9od, the leader of the people called the \u00c9oth\u00e9od who lived in the far north near the source of the Anduin. In TA 2501 when Eorl was sixteen years old, L\u00e9od was killed by a wild horse that he had tried to tame; for this act the horse was called Mansbane by the \u00c9oth\u00e9od. Eorl hunted the horse and rather than kill him required that the horse serve him and surrender his freedom as a Weregild. The horse submitted and Eorl renamed him Felar\u00f3f. Felar\u00f3f became Eorl's steed and was the father of the Mearas, who were the steeds of Eorl's descendants. It was also said that Felar\u00f3f would not permit any other man to ride him.\nEorl succeeded his father as the leader of the \u00c9oth\u00e9od. They were a numerous people with many horses. They needed more room to roam, but there was nowhere for them to go.\nOn March 25, TA 2510 - when Eorl was twenty-five years old - an errand-rider named Borondir arrived with a message from Cirion, the Steward of Gondor. Gondor was being threatened by Men from Rh\u00fbn called the Balchoth, and Cirion sought Eorl's help in defeating them. Eorl agreed to come, because he knew that if Gondor fell, all of Middle-earth would soon be conquered. Borondir was one of several errand riders sent out by the Stewards, but the only one to get through, due to the intervening enemies. Eorl assembled his Council of Elders to prepare to ride south.\nOn April 6 , Eorl rode forth with an \u00c9oher\u00eb - or mounted army - of 7,000 fully armed Riders and several hundred mounted archers. Only a few hundred Riders were left behind to guard the women, children, and elderly. The \u00e9oher\u00eb rode southward through the Vales of the Anduin - a journey of over 500 miles.\nWhen they passed Dol Guldur in Mirkwood - where Sauron dwelled in secret - a darkness emanated from the fortress, and Eorl turned westward to avoid it. But then a white mist came from the woods of Lothl\u00f3rien that stood across the River from Dol Guldur, and the Riders were hidden and continued safely on their way and, under the protection of the mist, apparently made the journey unwearyingly at an extraordinary rate of speed.\nEorl arrived at the Field of Celebrant on the morning of April 15. Gondor's army was being attacked on two fronts by the Balchoth and Orcs from the Misty Mountains. Eorl and his Riders attacked the enemy from the rear, slaying many and driving the rest across the River Limlight. South of the Limlight lay the province of Gondor called Calenardhon, and Eorl and his Riders pursued the surviving enemies until the land was free of them.\nAfter the Battle of the Field of Celebrant, Eorl accompanied Cirion to the Mering Stream on the southeastern border of Calenardhon, where they parted company. Cirion asked Eorl to meet him there again in three months and committed Calenardhon to Eorl's care in the meantime.\nStatues of Eorl (right) and Cirion erected near the site of their first meeting (The Lord of the Rings Online\nWhen they met again in August of 2510, Cirion brought Eorl to Halifirien, the Hill of Awe, also known as Amon Anwar because, unknown to all but the Steward and those in his deepest confidence, the Tomb of Elendil had stood since being placed there by Isildur after the fall of Sauron. There Cirion offered Eorl the land of Calenardhon as a new homeland for his people in gratitude for their service to Gondor. Eorl was deeply grateful for the Gift of Cirion, whom he admired as the wisest of all men then in Middle-earth. He accepted and he swore an oath that his people would always come to Gondor's aid in time of need. Eorl realized that their peoples needed to remain allies in order to face the growing danger in Middle-earth. Cirion took a similar oath on behalf of the people of Gondor.\nEorl left about half his force to guard Calenardhon and returned to the far north to gather his people and their possessions. He led them back to their new homeland, and it became known as the Mark. In Gondor, the new land of their allies was called Rohan.\nEorl was King of the Mark for 35 years. He chose the hill at the entrance to the valley of Harrowdale to be the site of the town of Edoras. But Meduseld, the Golden Hall, was not completed in Eorl's lifetime, and he dwelled at Aldburg in the Folde. Eorl's son Brego was born in TA 2512.\nIn TA 2545, Rohan was attacked by Easterlings. The attack was thwarted, but Eorl fell in battle. He was buried in a mound outside Edoras, and his horse Felar\u00f3f was buried with him. His son Brego succeeded him as King of Rohan.\nRohan continued to be ruled by the House of Eorl, and the people of Rohan called themselves the Eorlingas, or the Sons of Eorl. The Oath of Eorl was not forgotten. During the War of the Ring, King Th\u00e9oden of Rohan honored his ancestor's Oath and came to Gondor's aid at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The Oath of Eorl was renewed by Th\u00e9oden's successor King \u00c9omer, who pledged continued friendship to Aragorn, King Elessar, of the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor.\nEorl in The Lord of the Rings Online",

Like her brother \u00c9omer, she was related to King Th\u00e9oden through their mother, the King's sister. Her father was slain and her mother died of illness in TA 3002. Afterwards, Th\u00e9oden took \u00c9omer and \u00c9owyn in his household and raised them as his children.\nWar of the Ring\nPrior to the War of the Ring, \u00c9owyn was forced to stay in Meduseld and care for her declining uncle for several years, as he was weakened by the influence of Saruman and Gr\u00edma Wormtongue. When Gandalf restored the King, he prepared to defend Rohan against Isengard. Since Th\u00e9oden planned to ride to battle himself, he asked his doorwarden H\u00e1ma, to suggest a leader for the people in his absence. H\u00e1ma recommended \u00c9owyn, who, though a woman, was \"fearless\" and \"all love[d] her\".\n\u00c9owyn during the exodus to Helm's Deep, by Venlian\n\u00c9owyn reluctantly obeyed the King's orders to lead the people of Edoras to shelter in the White Mountains, while Aragorn, Th\u00e9oden, and the rest of the men bravely faced Saruman's army in the Battle of the Hornburg. When Aragorn passed through Dunharrow to take the Paths of the Dead she confessed her growing feelings for him, but already betrothed, he reluctantly refused her.\nWhen Denethor II urgently called for Th\u00e9oden's aid against Mordor, \u00c9owyn again, begged to be allowed to ride to battle, but Th\u00e9oden refused.\n\u00c9owyn beside Th\u00e9oden her uncle, as seen by Angelo Montanini\nResentfully, she disguised herself as a man, taking the alias Dernhelm, and rode to Minas Tirith on her horse Windfola. She took Meriadoc Brandybuck along because he likewise wanted to follow his friends to battle, but had been refused by Th\u00e9oden. Because \u00c9owyn weighed less than a man of similar height, Windfola was able to bear both her and Merry.[1]\nIn the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, she fought in Th\u00e9oden's escort; when he and his company were attacked by the Witch-king of Angmar, Lord of the Nazg\u00fbl, she and Merry were the only riders who did not flee. As Th\u00e9oden lay mortally wounded and crushed beneath Snowmane, \u00c9owyn challenged the Witch-king, who boasted that \"no living man may hinder me\". In answer, she removed her helmet, releasing her hair, which \"gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders\", and declared, \"But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. \u00c9owyn I am, \u00c9omund's daughter... Begone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.\"[3]\n\u00c9owyn as Dernhelm riding with Merry and the Rohirrim to Minas Tirith - by Matthew Stewart\nIn a rage, the Witch-king attacked her, but she clove the head of his winged steed. The Witch-king shattered her shield with a blow of his mace, breaking her arm, but stumbled when Merry stabbed his leg from behind with the Barrow-blade. \u00c9owyn drove her sword through the Witch-king's head, killing him[3] and fulfilling Glorfindel's prophecy from a thousand years earlier, at the Battle of Fornost, that \"not by the hand of man\" would the Witch-king fall.[6]\n\u00c9owyn facing the Witch-king, by Donato Giancola\nHer constitution already weakened by loneliness and despair, combined with physical injuries, \u00c9owyn then succumbed to the Black Breath. Th\u00e9oden, not knowing that she was nearby, told Merry with his dying words that she had been \"dearer than daughter\" to him. Seeing her lying apparently dead on the battlefield caused her brother \u00c9omer to go temporarily mad, and charge in fury at the enemy. But during the battle she was found by Prince Imrahil, who noticed that she was still alive, though barely, and ordered her taken to the Houses of Healing. There she was healed there by Aragorn, the cure of the plant\u00a0Athelas, and the entreaties of her distraught brother.[7]\n\u00c9owyn at the Houses of Healing\n\u00c9owyn remained behind in Minas Tirith while the Army of the West marched toward the Black Gate, to challenge Sauron. She met and fell in love with Faramir, who had likewise been injured before the battle. After the War of the Ring had ended, she decided to give up dreams of glory in battle and devote her life to peace and a happy marriage.[7]\nLater years\nAt \u00c9owyn's insistence, Merry was made a Knight of the Riddermark. He attended Th\u00e9oden's funeral and \u00c9omer's coronation as King of Rohan, where \u00c9owyn presented Merry with a parting gift: the Horn of Rohan, a small silver horn taken from the hoard of Scatha, the dragon.\nFaramir and \u00c9owyn settled in Ithilien, where they had at least one son, Elboron, and their grandson was Barahir, who wrote The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen in the Fourth Age.

She and her parents lived in the N\u00famen\u00f3rean region of Emeri\u00eb, which she loved dearly.\nShe was in love with Aldarion for a long while but was reluctant to marry him because of his love of the sea and did not like the time he spent on frequent and long voyages.

        "biography": "The son of Siriondil, and a great-great grandson of King Telumehtar from a cadet branch of the House of An\u00e1rion, E\u00e4rnil II was selected to become king in TA 1945 after his predecessor, King Ondoher and his heirs, Artamir and Faramir, were slain in battle.\nIn the previous year a two-pronged attack had been launched upon Gondor by the Haradrim and the Wainriders. In response, King Ondoher led the main army north to counter the Easterling invasion, but was ambushed before the Black Gate, defeated and killed. E\u00e4rnil was commander of Gondor's southern army and guarded Ithilien. E\u00e4rnil led his army into Southern Ithilien where he won a great victory over the Haradrim and Variags. This enabled him to turn his attention to the invading Wainriders. The Wainriders, certain of victory, were celebrating their success before entering Minas Anor. They were unaware of E\u00e4rnil's victory in the south and were taken by surprise when E\u00e4rnil, having linked up with elements of the retreating Northern Army, suddenly attacked them. As a result E\u00e4rnil overwhelmed and destroyed them in the Battle of the Camp.\nAfter the threat was eliminated Gondor's attention shifted towards Steward Pelendur and the Council of Gondor, for King Ondoher along with his two sons were slain at the Black Gate. Both E\u00e4rnil and Prince Arvedui of Arthedain (successor state of Arnor) claimed the throne. Arvedui based his claim on that he was the direct descendant of Isildur (second High King of Arnor and Gondor and founder of the realm), and as the husband of F\u00edriel, only surviving child of King Ondoher. The claim was rejected and E\u00e4rnil of the House of An\u00e1rion was elected king for his deeds, heritage, and because Pelendur claimed that \"The crown and royalty of Gondor belongs solely to the heirs of Meneldil, son of An\u00e1rion, to whom Isildur relinquished this realm. In Gondor, this heritage is reckoned through the sons only; and we have not heard that the law is otherwise in Arnor\". He reigned as E\u00e4rnil II.\nAside from being a gifted general E\u00e4rnil also was a wise ruler. He sent messages to Arvedui announcing that he received the crown of Gondor, according to the laws and the needs of the South-Kingdom, \"but I do not forget the royalty of Arnor, nor deny our kinship, nor wish that the realms of Elendil be estranged. I will send to your aid when you have need, so far as I am able.\" And at last in the autumn of 1973, messages came to Gondor that Arthedain was in great peril, and that the Witch-king of Angmar was preparing a final stroke against it. Then E\u00e4rnil sent his son E\u00e4rnur north with a fleet, as swiftly as he could, and with as great a strength as he could spare to aid Arvedui (now King). E\u00e4rnur arrived too late to save Arthedain and Arvedui who had fled north (and was drowned in the Icebay of Forochel) but managed to defeat the Kingdom of Angmar in the Battle of Fornost with the help of C\u00edrdan, the Lord of the Grey Havens and Glorfindel with a force from Rivendell. There, E\u00e4rnur earned the hatred of the Witch-king.\nHowever, E\u00e4rnil was not able to withstand the takeover of Minas Ithil by the Nazg\u00fbl. Minas Anor was subsequently renamed Minas Tirith (Tower of Guard) and Minas Ithil became Minas Morgul (Tower of Sorcery).\nE\u00e4rnil died in TA 2043 after a rule of ninety-eight years and was succeeded by his son E\u00e4rnur, who was as good a general as his father but lacked his wisdom, and who would be the last King before Aragorn reclaimed his throne after a long gap.[2] For the duration of the rule of the Stewards of Gondor, the silver crown of Gondor rested in the lap of King E\u00e4rnil.",

It was to him that Glorfindel stated his prophecy that \"not by the hand of men shall he fall\", referring to the Witch-king as he fled from defeat. After becoming King in TA 2043, he was challenged by the Witch-king, chief of the Ringwraiths, who then resided in Minas Morgul. E\u00e4rnur, being quick to anger and wrath, would have accepted his challenge had the wise Steward Mardil Voronw\u00eb not held him back, and so the first challenge went unanswered.\nIn TA 2050 a second challenge came, mocking E\u00e4rnur for his supposed cowardice in the face of the Witch-king at the Battle of Fornost, and Mardil was not able to stop E\u00e4rnur from accepting the challenge. After entering the gates of Minas Morgul with a small escort, E\u00e4rnur was never heard from again. His crown lay on his father's tomb in the Hallows of Minas Tirith.\nThe Line of An\u00e1rion was broken with E\u00e4rnur's disappearance, and the rule of Gondor passed to the Stewards, beginning with Mardil Voronw\u00eb, who had tried to restrain E\u00e4rnur from going to Minas Morgul to face the Witch-king. The Stewards were to rule \"until the King returns\", for it was then unknown whether E\u00e4rnur had been killed duelling the Witch-king or not. E\u00e4rnur had also left without naming an heir, and while many nobles in Gondor could lay some sort of claim to the kingship, no claim would be accepted by all, and no one wanted to risk a second civil war.[2]",

        "biography": "Early life[]\nFinduilas, by Catherine Chmiel.\nFaramir was born in the year TA 2983 to Denethor II and Finduilas, daughter of Adrahil of Dol Amroth.[1] The following year, his grandfather Ecthelion II died and his father, Denethor, succeeded him as the Ruling Steward of Gondor.[8]\nWhen Faramir was five years old, Finduilas died. Her death caused Denethor to become detached from his family. The relationship between Faramir and Boromir, who was five years older, grew much closer and greater in love. Although the siblings were very similar in appearance with their dark hair and grey eyes, it was not so in personality. Boromir was defined to be the more daring one, as well as the more fearless and strong warrior. Faramir\u2019s boldness was incorrectly judged less due to his gentle nature and love of lore and music. Despite the obvious way that Denethor favored Boromir over Faramir, and their significant differences in personality, there was never any jealousy or rivalry between the brothers. Boromir always protected and helped Faramir, and Faramir in turn greatly admired his older brother.\nIt was this interest that formed a friendship between Faramir and Gandalf the Grey. The youngest son of Denethor learned of what he could from Gandalf\u2019s wisdom and mentoring. Denethor did not approve of Faramir as the \"Wizard's pupil\", for he neither trusted nor liked the Istar.[7]\nFaramir's leadership, skill-in-arms, and swift but hardy judgment proved handy on the battlefield. During the War of the Ring, he was the Captain of the Rangers of Ithilien, who often skirmished with allies of Sauron in that province. Faramir valiantly defended Gondor from the Enemy, but did not enjoy fighting for its own sake.\nWar of the Ring[]\nDefending Osgiliath[]\nFaramir and Boromir at the time of the Witch-king's assault on Osgiliath\nIn June of 3018, Sauron's forces attacked Osgiliath under the command of the Witch-king, whose presence caused the soldiers to flee across the Anduin. When the last bridge was destroyed, Boromir and Faramir were upon it. With two others, they swam ashore and managed to drive the Orcs back from the Anduin's west shores.[9]\nA fateful dream[]\nThe night before the assault on the city, Faramir had a prophetic dream in which a great wave covered all the land as darkness fell, with a voice out of the west speaking a riddle:\n\u201fSeek for the Sword that was broken:\nIn Imladris it dwells;\nThere shall be counsels taken\nStronger than Morgul-spells.\nThere shall be shown a token\nThat Doom is near at hand,\nFor Isildur's Bane shall waken,\nAnd the Halfling forth shall stand\u201d\n\u2014Faramir's dream[9]\nIt came to Faramir twice more, and once to his brother, and the brothers described it to Denethor, who only replied saying only that Imladris was an Elvish name for Rivendell, home of Elrond. Although Faramir had wanted to go for Gondor\u2019s sake, Boromir decided to go instead, for he heard that the way was fraught with dark and danger. He also considered himself to be a better warrior that Faramir, and therefore more likely to survive the perilous journey. Although he encountered some resistance from Denethor, who did not wish for Gondor's finest captain to leave him in those dark times, Boromir still went. Boromir traveled for nearly four months to reach Rivendell, and although he lost his horse near Tharbad, he still arrived just in time for the Council of Elrond.\nFinding Boromir's body in the Anduin\nOn February 29, 3019 at midnight, Faramir, who was on guard duty on the western shore in Osgiliath, waded down to a boat floating down the Anduin river. To his grief, it contained the dead body of his brother which was pierced with many wounds. In it lay his sword, broken, but there was no sign of the Great Horn, which he and his father had heard distantly blowing to the North three days prior.\nDiscovering the One Ring[]\nFaramir with Frodo and Sam in Ithilien\n\"But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs, Frodo son of Drogo.\"\n\u2014Faramir to Frodo after guessing what the Hobbit carries[6]\nDuring a battle with Southrons, Faramir, who had taken over his brother's position as the Captain of the White Tower, encountered the Hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, recognizing them to be the Halflings his dream spoke of. After the skirmish, Faramir questioned Frodo about his riddle and Isildur's Bane, but, realizing what he was talking about, quickly switched to the topic of Boromir's death and sought answers as to its circumstances. He then decided to take the pair to Henneth Ann\u00fbn.[3]\nEn route, Faramir continued questioning Frodo confidentially, and based on Frodo's answers and his own intuition determined that Frodo was carrying some great evil weapon of the Dark Lord of the Enemy. But rather than take it for himself or Gondor, he assured Frodo he would never use such as weapon.\nFaramir ate with Frodo and Sam, and listened to Frodo's tales of their journey up to that point, and in turn told the Hobbits of Gondor's decline. During their discussion, Sam accidentally revealed Boromir's desire for the Enemy\u2019s Ring, Isildur's Bane. Despite the hobbits\u2019 fears, Faramir remained true to his vow, for he was wise enough to realize that such a weapon could not be used for good. With this knowledge, he also realized the peril his brother had faced.[6]\nOn the very same night, Gollum was spotted fishing in the Forbidden Pool next to Henneth Ann\u00fbn\u2014an act punishable by death. However Faramir listened to Frodo\u2019s pleas to spare Gollum\u2019s life, and after interrogating the creature he decided that Frodo and Sam would be free in the Lands of Gondor and Gollum under Frodo's protection. Giving them provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest. At their parting, Faramir warned Frodo of Gollum's treacherous nature and that the path Gollum had proposed (Cirith Ungol) had an evil reputation of old.[4]\nSiege of Gondor[]\nFaramir and his company retreated to Cair Andros, an island in the River Anduin that guarded the northern approaches to Minas Tirith. After noting that the sky was now covered in complete darkness, Faramir sent his company south to reinforce the garrison at Osgiliath while he and three of his men rode to Minas Tirith directly. Along the way, they were pursued by the Nazg\u00fbl, riding Black Wings.\u00a0The men, except Faramir, were unhorsed and it was the Captain, a master of both beasts and men, who was still horsed and rode back to aid the fallen. If\u00a0Gandalf had not intervened, they would have surely perished.\nArriving at Minas Tirith, Faramir reported to Denethor and\u00a0Gandalf of his encounter with Frodo and Sam. Denethor was angered that Faramir had not brought the Ring to Gondor, wishing that he and his brother\u2019s places had been reversed, since Denethor believed that Boromir would have brought the Enemy\u2019s weapon to him.\nDenethor sent his remaining son to hold Western Osgiliath against the hosts of the Enemy that outnumbered their own greatly. Although Faramir disagreed with his father\u2019s strategy, he agreed to go.\nFaramir: \"Then farewell! But if I should return, think better of me!\"\nDenethor: \"That depends on the manner of your return.\"\n\u2014Faramir and Denethor's exchange of words[7]\nAfter a day of fighting the Witch-king's army overwhelmed the men of Gondor and won Osgiliath. Faramir drew back to the Causeway Forts, the defence of which lasted another day, with many of the defenders being wounded or killed. Faramir decided to stay with the rear guard in order to make sure that the retreat over Pelennor Fields would not turn into a rout. As the force neared Minas Tirith it was overtaken by Orcs and Haradrim and Faramir was gravely wounded by a poisonous arrow. Fortunately, Gandalf and Faramir's uncle, Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth, led a cavalry sortie that successfully covered the retreat. Imrahil bore Faramir back to Denethor, telling him that his son had done great deeds.\nFaramir placed on the pyre at Denethor's command\nRegretting that he had thanklessly sent his son off in needless peril without his blessing, Denethor, after looking in the palant\u00edr, believed that the Ring was captured and the end was near. Thus he ordered his servants to build a funeral pyre for him and his son. Despite the protests of the Hobbit, Peregrin Took (serving the Steward in payment of Boromir's death) that Faramir was still alive, Denethor continued with his plans and released the Hobbit from his service.[10]\nHorrified, Pippin went to alert Gandalf and Beregond, one of the Tower Guards. Beregond, who loved his captain enough to abandon his post and risk his life protecting him, stopped the servants from lighting the pyre, killing several. Pippin returned with Gandalf, who intervened by taking Faramir off the pyre as Faramir moaned out to his father in his fevered dreams. Denethor took out a knife, trying to take Faramir back, but Beregond placed himself in front of Faramir. Seeing that he could not win, Denethor lit the pyre and laid himself down upon it, burning himself alive.[10]\nHealing Faramir, by Anke Eissmann\nRecovery and last days of the Third Age[]\nThen, Faramir was laid in the Houses of Healing. His wound from the Haradrim arrow, along with weariness and grief concerning his constantly strained relationship with his father and the Black Breath of the Nazg\u00fbl (who had hunted Faramir ever since he had left Ithilien), all contributed to his near-death. After the battle, Aragorn came and revived him with athelas. When he awoke, Faramir immediately recognized Aragorn as his rightful king.[5]\nBefore Aragorn left to lead the soldiers to the Black Gate, he commanded the Warden of the Houses of Healing to have Faramir and \u00c9owyn\u00a0to remain resting for at least ten days. After \u00c9owyn demanded that the Warden take her to the Steward of the City to have her released so she could ride out in battle, Faramir, whose heart was moved with pity and pierced by her beauty, told \u00c9owyn that he too, had to heed the advice of the Warden. He fulfilled her request to have her room look east to Mordor and asked her to talk with him at times.[5]\nFaramir and \u00c9owyn walked together in the gardens nearly every day, and he learned from Merry Brandybuck of \u00c9owyn's despair of feeling trapped, waiting on the waning of\u00a0Th\u00e9oden, and of Aragorn's rejection of her love.[5]\nFaramir and \u00c9owyn together looking towards Mordor\nOn March 25, Faramir gave \u00c9owyn a dark blue mantle sewn with silver stars that had once belonged to his mother Finduilas, as they stood at the wall that looked towards Mordor. There, they saw a threatening darkness towering over and seeing this, Faramir told her of his dream of the Downfall of N\u00famenor and that the darkness threatening to overtake Middle-earth reminded him of the great wave that swallowed the island. Somehow, to Faramir and the people of the city, a hope and joy welled in their hearts and he kissed \u00c9owyn\u2019s brow. They were later informed by an eagle that Sauron had fallen for good, and that Aragorn would return as king.[11]\n\u00c9owyn, however, still felt languished and unfulfilled. Several days after he gave her the mantle, Faramir told her that he understood that she desired to be lifted in greatness and out of the cage she had felt trapped in, and when Aragorn only gave her understanding and pity, instead of love, she had wanted to die valiantly and gloriously in battle. He told her that though he had first pitied her, he now loved her. There, \u00c9owyn\u2019s grief was fully healed, and no longer did she desire glory or greatness and realized that she had come to love Faramir in return.[11]\nFaramir briefly served as the Ruling Steward of Gondor, and began preparing the city for the King's arrival. On the day of the King\u2019s official coronation on May 1, Faramir surrendered his office, which was represented by the white rod of the Steward, kneeling as he did so. Aragorn however, gave the rod back, announcing that as long as his line would last, Faramir and his descendants would be Stewards of Gondor. After Faramir had asked the people of Gondor if they accepted Aragorn as their King (which they did), Faramir took the Crown of Gondor out and Aragorn was crowned King Elessar by Gandalf.\nLater years[]\nKing Elessar appointed Faramir as the Prince of Ithilien, and Beregond to be the Captain of his guard, the White Company. As Prince of Ithilien, he and the Prince of Dol Amroth, Gondor's two highest-ranking nobles, became King Elessar's chief commanders. His duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and Orcs and cleansing the Morgul Vale of evil remnants. Faramir also fulfilled the traditional role as Steward, acting as the King\u2019s chief counsellor as well as ruling Gondor in the King's absence.\nFamily portrait, by Anke Eissmann\nAfter the funeral of Th\u00e9oden, Faramir married \u00c9owyn in Edoras.[12] After their marriage, the two settled in Emyn Arnen, where they had at least one son, named Elboron. Elboron would succeed Faramir as Steward of Gondor, Prince of Ithilien, and Lord of Emyn Arnen, after Faramir's death in FO 82.[13]  Faramir lived to be 120 years old, becoming the first Steward since Belecthor II to pass 100, as by a quirk, the blood of N\u00famenor ran true in him. One of his grandsons, Barahir, wrote the Tale of Aragorn and Arwen.[14][15]",

        "biography": "Life in Valinor[]\n\"Get thee gone, and take thy due place!\", by Jenny Dolfen\nFingolfin was born in Tirion in Valinor during the Noontide of Valinor. Neither he nor his brothers were particularly close to F\u00ebanor; their elder half-brother had been opposed to his father remarrying, and thus he was rather scornful of them. Nonetheless, he lived in peace with his kin for many centuries. However, the peace of Valinor was brought to an end when Melkor, the most powerful of the Valar and the source of evil in Arda, was released from imprisonment. Feigning repentance and rehabilitation, Melkor's malice had in fact only festered and grown worse while imprisoned, and he sought to bring ruin upon the Elves for, as he saw it, causing his downfall. Of the three clans of Elves in Aman, only the \u00d1oldor welcomed him, as his knowledge was the greatest of any of the Valar. Gaining their confidence, Melkor was slowly able to spread lies and half-truths amongst them regarding the intentions of the Valar. Over time, these lies bore fruit and the \u00d1oldor began to openly debate remaining in Aman, and chief among the disgruntled Elves was F\u00ebanor. One of the lies was that the sons of Indis, of which Fingolfin was the eldest, were trying to usurp F\u00ebanor as the rightful heir of Finw\u00eb and seize the Silmarils, three magnificently beautiful gems that F\u00ebanor had created, for themselves.\nF\u00ebanor, already not fond of his half-siblings, had little trouble believing the rumor. F\u00ebanor hastened to Tirion and confronted Fingolfin, drawing his sword and threatening him with violence. When it became known what F\u00ebanor had done to Fingolfin, he was called by the Valar to explain himself, and Melkor's lies were found out. However, F\u00ebanor was held accountable for threatening Fingolfin and was banished to the fortress of Formenos in the north.[4] Around twelve years later, the two brothers reconciled at a festival in Valinor (though F\u00ebanor did so only grudgingly). However, during this festival, Melkor and the monstrous spider Ungoliant attacked, killing the Two Trees of Valinor and darkening all of Aman. They then assaulted the fortress of Formenos, where Melkor slew Finw\u00eb and stole F\u00ebanor's Silmarils. In his pride, grief, anger, and selfishness, F\u00ebanor sought revenge upon Melkor (now named Morgoth), and attempted to convince the rest of the \u00d1oldor to assist him by convincing them that journeying to Middle-earth would bring them glories and treasures untold. However, many were either not convinced or only half convinced, and deferred to Fingolfin, who was more trusted than his brother. Fingolfin, though not particularly keen to leave Valinor, had sworn to F\u00ebanor to uphold his place as the elder brother, and did not want to abandon his people to the decisions of his rash and selfish brother. He decided to accompany F\u00ebanor.[5]\nLife in Middle-earth[]\nFingolfin Leads the Host Across the Helcarax\u00eb, by Ted Nasmith\nAs such, Fingolfin ended up becoming the leader of the second and largest of the three \u00d1oldor hosts to leave Tirion for Middle-earth. F\u00ebanor led the first, and Fingolfin's brother Finarfin led the third, smallest, and most reluctant host. Most of those who journeyed with Fingolfin were, though willing to leave Tirion, in no great hurry to do so, and so it took a longer time for them to start their journey than F\u00ebanor's host. Unfortunately, this delay caused Fingolfin to make a grievous mistake, for not long after setting out, F\u00ebanor attempted to seize the fleet of the seafaring Teleri Elves in order to get to Middle-earth. The Teleri resisted fiercely, and the vanguard of Fingolfin's host, led by Fingon, caught up with F\u00ebanor's during the middle of a heated battle. Seeing this, Fingon mistakenly assumed that the Teleri had attempted to waylay the \u00d1oldor, perhaps even at the request of the Valar. He and the vanguard joined the battle against the Teleri, and soon thereafter, the rest of Fingolfin's host joined as well. The Teleri were overcome, and the resulting slaughter became known as the Kinslaying at Alqualond\u00eb. After the battle and the theft of the ships, the \u00d1oldor encountered a figure, possibly Mandos himself, who proclaimed a terrible Doom upon them for the Kinslaying. Hearing this, and having not participated at all in the slaughter of the Teleri, Finarfin's host turned back and returned to Tirion.\nThe rest of the \u00d1oldor continued north, but as the journey grew more and more dangerous, many of the \u00d1oldor, upset about the Kinslaying and having been reluctant in the first place, began to openly curse F\u00ebanor. In response, he and those most loyal to him departed one night on the Teleri ships. Upon reaching Middle-earth, F\u00ebanor burned the ships. The fires were spotted by Fingolfin's host, and they knew that they were betrayed. Fingolfin's host's only route to Middle-earth was now to cross the phenomenally dangerous ices of the Helcarax\u00eb or to return to Tirion in disgrace and suffer the punishment of the Valar for their role in the Kinslaying. But Fingolfin wished to continue to Middle-earth, in no small part to confront the brother for his monstrous betrayal. Fingolfin's host chose to cross the Helcarax\u00eb, but lost many of its members along the way, greatly increasing the wrath and bitterness that Fingolfin and his host felt for F\u00ebanor's host. The host of Fingolfin finally arrived in Middle-earth at the rising of the\u00a0Sun (FA 1) and was assailed by an Orc army in Lammoth resulting in the death of Fingolfin's youngest child. Destroying the Orc host, Fingolfin and his army approached the doors of Angband, Morgoth's great fortress and smote upon them, but Morgoth and his servants, dismayed by the light of the new Sun, stayed hidden inside. Fingolfin and the \u00d1oldor then came to the northern shores of Lake Mithrim (FA 2), from which the F\u00ebanorian part of the host had withdrawn.\nWith virtually all of Fingolfin's host furious over F\u00ebanor's betrayal, a civil war would almost certainly have broken out amongst the \u00d1oldor had it not been for the actions of Fingolfin's son Fingon. For after the initial confrontation of F\u00ebanor's host against Morgoth's forces, the Elves had defeated their foes with relative ease, but F\u00ebanor in his pride and wrath had thought to come upon Morgoth himself, and had pursued the remnants of Morgoth's army with only a small vanguard. Upon reaching Angband, this vanguard encountered a few Balrogs and had quickly been slain, with F\u00ebanor falling at the hands of Gothmog, Lord of the Balrogs. After this, Morgoth had sent a false claim of parley to the new leader of F\u00ebanor's host; his eldest son Maedhros. Expecting treachery, both sides sent greater force than agreed upon to the negotiation site, but Morgoth's had been accompanied by Balrogs, who slew the Elven company in short order and captured Maedhros. After failing to gain concessions from the Elves by offering to release Maedhros, Morgoth chained Maedhros to a cliff by one hand and left him there. Fingon quickly learned of this and, having been a great friend of Maedhros before F\u00ebanor's divisive actions, he sought to rescue his friend and cousin. He succeeded, and both returned to the gathered \u00d1oldor, who were amazed at Fingon's actions. Seeking to keep his people united, Maedhros waived all claim to kingship, and Fingolfin thus became the first High King of the \u00d1oldor (YS 7). They were quickly able to establish mighty kingdoms in Beleriand, and subsequent attacks by Morgoth against them were repelled completely and with relative ease. Fingolfin established the Siege of Angband after the complete victory of Dagor Aglareb, and ruled in peace and prosperity from Hithlum, by the northern shores of Lake Mithrim. On FA 20, he hosted the famous feast of Mereth Aderthad in Eithel Ivrin, which was attended by emissaries from all the Elves in Beleriand.[6] There Fingolfin retained close counsel and friendship with Maedhros.\nMorgoth before Fingolfin\nCombat with Morgoth and death[]\nAfter Dagor Aglareb, occasional raids and sorties would be launched from Angband, but the Elven forces keeping watch upon the fortress were able to repel these with relative ease. As the centuries past, these attacks became fewer in number as Morgoth came to realize that the Orcs unaided were simply no match for the Elves in anything less than overwhelming numbers. Thus the Elven kingdoms experienced a golden age lasting for around four hundred and fifty years, and green grass grew even to the gates of Angband. With the power of his people waxing, Fingolfin began to toy with the idea of directly assaulting Angband, and perhaps ridding the Elves entirely of the looming threat that was Morgoth. However, the idea was never acted upon in any meaningful sense. Most of the Elven lords were effectively content with the situation as it stood, and were reluctant to begin an endevor which, even in victory, would be costly in the extreme. Ultimately it made no difference, as neither Fingolfin nor his allies yet fully comprehended the power of Morgoth, and did not understand that overthrowing him or assaulting Angband in earnest were simply beyond their capabilities.\nMorgoth himself was not idle during the four hundred years of the siege, and he spent the time increasing the strength of his forces and creating new, deadlier creatures than Orcs for his armies. After reaching what he believed to be sufficient levels of soldiers, Morgoth's armies burst into Beleriand in the Dagor Bragollach. Accompanied by massive volcanic eruptions, the Orcs, Balrogs, and the dragon Glaurung completely overran the Elven defenses surrounding Angband, driving far into the south of Beleriand and slaughtering untold numbers of Elves. Fingolfin's kingdom in Hithlum managed barely to defend itself, as the mountains surrounding it provided protection against the flame and magma Morgoth had caused to spew from the Iron Mountains. However most of the other kingdoms of the \u00d1oldor were destroyed, and many of their allies, both Elven and Edain, were slain.\nThe apparent totality of the defeat caused a great rage and despair to overcome Fingolfin, and he resolved to go to Angband and challenge Morgoth himself to single combat. He mounted his horse and proceeded to ride across\u00a0Anfauglith\u00a0with such wrath that it was said that those who saw him mistook him for the Vala Orom\u00eb. He rode to Angband, unhindered by any of Morgoth's servants, smote upon the gates and shouted a challenge for Morgoth to face him in single combat. Morgoth, though still said to be the \"mightiest of all things in this world\", was reluctant to face Fingolfin because despite his might, he alone of the Valar knew fear. But Fingolfin's challenge was made in such an insulting manner that Morgoth could not ignore it without losing face before his captains. As such, he donned black armor, took up a great hammer, and emerged from Angband. Fingolfin drew his sword, Ringil, and the duel began. Many times Morgoth attempted to smite Fingolfin, but the Elven King managed to dodge all of Morgoth's blows, and wounded the Dark Lord seven times. But at last Fingolfin grew weary, and Morgoth bore down upon the Elven king with his gigantic shield, thrice driving Fingolfin to his knees. Fingolfin rose up and continued to fight each time, but as Mandos had foretold, no power of the Elves could defeat Morgoth, a Vala. Eventually, Fingolfin stumbled backwards into one of the many pits carved by Morgoth's failed strikes, and Morgoth stepped on the Elven King's neck and killed him. However, Fingolfin's last, desperate stroke managed to cut into Morgoth's heel.[7]\nAfter defeating him, Morgoth took Fingolfin's body and broke it, intending to feed it to his wolves. But Thorondor, the King of Eagles, swooped down upon Morgoth and with his talons slashed at Morgoth's face. As Morgoth reeled from this new assault, Thorondor retrieved Fingolfin's body and brought it to a mountaintop overlooking Gondolin. Turgon built a cairn named Sarnas Fingolfin over the remains of his father, and Fingon, in sorrow, became High King of the \u00d1oldor. After Fingolfin's defeat, though he had been defeated by Morgoth, the Orcs never made any type of boastful song to celebrate, nor did the Elves sing of it, for their sorrow was far too great. Morgoth walked with a limp after the duel, and the wounds he received pained him forever.[7]",

When the \u00d1oldor were resolved to return to Middle-earth, Fingon followed his father and his people, though they were drawn more to the ruling of their own realms and adventurism rather than vengeance and the recovery of the Silmarils, as F\u00ebanor and his sons sought. He fought in the first Kinslaying but only because he, seeing Elf fighting Elf, believed that the Teleri had been told to prevent the \u00d1oldor from leaving Aman by force by the Valar.[3]\nAfter F\u00ebanor's abandonment of them, Fingon and his people were led by Fingolfin across the perilous Helcarax\u00eb. They arrived in Middle-earth at the beginning of the First Age, and the \u00d1oldor witnessed the rising of the Sun.\nThe Children of Fingolfin\nAfter the Dagor-nuin-Giliath and the death of F\u00ebanor, Maedhros, Fingon's cousin and friend, was taken and hung by the wrist upon Thangorodrim. Fingon went to Thangorodrim and with the help of Thorondor, Lord of the Eagles, found Maedhros. Maedhros begged Fingon to kill him, but Fingon instead severed Maedhros's hand by the wrist, and brought him back to the \u00d1oldorin camp. It was this act of bravery and compassion that resolved the dispute as to whose house would rule over the \u00d1oldor in Middle-earth, for Maedhros renounced his claim to the High Kingship of the \u00d1oldor, instead ceding it to the House of Fingolfin.[4]\nFingolfin gave Fingon a domain in Dor-l\u00f3min, in the west of Hithlum, where he did good service during the Siege of Angband, defeating an Orc army that attempted to go around to the north and attack Hithlum from the west, and then later the first to fight against the dragon Glaurung when he first came forth from Angband during the Dagor Aglareb.[5]\nFingon became High King when Fingolfin died dueling with Morgoth after the Dagor Bragollach. Seven years later, Morgoth's forces invaded Hithlum, and Fingon was hard-pressed and outnumbered, but C\u00edrdan and the people of the Falas, who came up the Firth of Drengist rescued them in their ships.[note 1][6]\nFingon's final battle was the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad. Fingon led the attack on Angband, and the fury of his warriors nearly won the day. Unfortunately, due to Ulfang's treachery, Maedhros did not arrive until three days after he was expected. This resulted in Morgoth releasing his Balrogs and Glaurung the dragon on the already weakened \u00d1oldor force. When Maedhros finally arrived, hope was reborn for Fingon's army; however, Ulfang's treachery again took effect, causing Maedhros to withdraw. Fingon was then surrounded and his guards killed. He dueled Gothmog, the first and greatest Lord of Balrogs, and managed to hold his own for a while. However Lungorthin, the second and lesser Balrog Lord emerged into elven history. This Balrog restrained Fingon from behind with a flaming whip, allowing Gothmog to split Fingon's head with his infamous black axe. Thus the day ended in defeat for the Elves.[7]\nHis younger brother Turgon became the next rightful High King of the \u00d1oldor, even though his host retreated after the battle and remained secretly in Gondolin.[8]\nFingon as imagined by Marya Filatova",

Finrod did not fight in the Kinslaying of Alqualond\u00eb nor was he aware of it as he continued the transit through Araman. While marching up the coast, the host encountered a\u00a0figure on a rock and heard the Prophecy of the North. Afterwards,\u00a0Finarfin and many of his followers departed and returned to Tirion, but Finrod chose to continue onto Middle-earth with the host of Fingolfin.[3]\nFinrod founded the original Minas Tirith in the Pass of Sirion. In around FA 50, he and his friend Turgon, while journeying down the river Sirion, encamped along its banks and were put to sleep by Ulmo. While asleep,\u00a0Ulmo revealed to them the hidden caves of Nargothrond and the Vale of Tumladen. Finrod discovered the system of caves beneath the Taur-en-Faroth, and with the help from the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains he started to build the city of Nargothrond and went on to found his own kingdom there.[4][5] Finrod rewarded the Dwarves with many jewels from Valinor. And in that time they made for him the\u00a0Nauglam\u00edr and gave him the honorific Felagund meaning  \"Hewer of Caves\".\nFinrod after crossing the Helcarax\u00eb, by Maureval\nWhile hunting in the lands of Thargelion in East Beleriand, Finrod was first of the \u00d1oldor to come across Men. He stayed with them\u00a0long, learning their language and teaching them Sindarin. He also intervened on behalf of the Laiquendi of Ossiriand, who feared Men would destroy their home, and he\u00a0received the\u00a0permission of King Thingol, who held overlordship over all Beleriand, to guide the Men to Estolad.[6]\nFinrod had a close friendship with Andreth of the House of B\u00ebor, whom he often visited during the Siege of Angband to converse with her on the matters of Elves and Men. One such conversation was written down and later known as Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth.\nDuring the Dagor Bragollach, Barahir of the House of B\u00ebor saved Finrod's life, and\u00a0in friendship\u00a0Finrod gave him his ring.[7] This ring was later known as the Ring of Barahir\u00a0and was eventually handed down to Aragorn when told of his true identity.\u00a0Years after the Dagor Bragollach,\u00a0Barahir's son Beren came to Nargothrond seeking help, and Finrod went with him on the Quest for the Silmaril to repay his debt, laying down his kingship. Celegorm and Curufin, who were living in Nargothrond at the time, persuaded (using fear of Morgoth, and barely veiled threats related to their Oath) most of Nargothrond to stay behind; only ten warriors, headed by one, Edrahil, were faithful and accompanied their King.[8]\nFinrod shortly before his death, by Anke Eissmann\nThough disguised by the arts of Finrod, the twelve were captured by Sauron and taken to Tol-in-Gaurhoth, formerly Minas Tirith, the castle Felagund himself had built. Finrod and Sauron battled with songs of power but despite a great display of skill and power by the Elven prince, Sauron eventually caught him in a devious trap and prevailed. But Sauron could not discern who exactly they were, even though they were revealed to him. Sauron imprisoned them, seeking to learn their errand and identities, sending a werewolf to devour them one by one until they revealed their secret, yet none did. Sauron however perceived that Finrod was a High Elven Lord of great power, and purposed to save him for last. Eventually, when the wolf came for Beren, Finrod burst his chains and killed the wolf barehanded but was mortally wounded himself.[8]\nFinrod swore an oath of abiding friendship and aid in every need to Barahir and all his kin, by Anke Eissmann\nFinrod loved Amari\u00eb, a Vanyarin Elf, who did not follow him to Middle-earth. For this, though she and Finrod were betrothed, Finrod never married while in Middle-earth.[9] It is noted in the Lay of L\u00fathien that Finrod was soon allowed to return to life in Valinor and \"now dwells with Amari\u00eb\" and was described as walking \"with Finarfin his father beneath the trees in Eldamar\".[8] Even though Mandos foretold that any of the exiles who died would never be allowed to leave his halls, Finrod alone was allowed to reembody in Valinor.\n\"...They buried the body of Felagund upon the hill-top of his own isle, and it was clean again; and the green grave of Finrod Finarfin's son, fairest of all the princes of the Elves, remained inviolate, until the land was changed and broken, and foundered under destroying seas.

The Elves, however, were suspicious of this call and were afraid. Orom\u00eb chose ambassadors from the three Elven kindreds\u2014the Vanyar, \u00d1oldor, and Teleri\u2014to return with him to Valinor. They would, in turn, report what they had seen to their kin. One of these ambassadors was Finw\u00eb, who, along with Ingw\u00eb and Elw\u00eb, went to the Blessed Realm with Orom\u00eb. When they returned, they were able to convince the Elves to go on the Great Journey into the far west.\nThere was great friendship between Finw\u00eb of the \u00d1oldor and Elw\u00eb of the Teleri. Then each became leaders of their own Elven-kindred. Thus, Finw\u00eb became the Lord of the \u00d1oldor who led his people on the Great Journey. And eventually, Finw\u00eb and the \u00d1oldor arrived in Valinor directly behind the Vanyar. There he and his people settled and Finw\u00eb thus became the First High King of the \u00d1oldor.\nFinw\u00eb near his wife M\u00edriel Serind\u00eb, by Steamey\nFinw\u00eb started a family, first marrying M\u00edriel Serind\u00eb who had also come with her people the \u00d1oldor to Aman. They had a son called F\u00ebanor, but her labors in giving birth to him drained her of most of her life, and she surrendered her soul to the Halls of Mandos shortly after bearing him. After a period of mourning, he married again. His second wife was Indis of the Vanyar. Indis bore him four children: Fingolfin, Finarfin, Findis, and \u00cdrim\u00eb.\nWhen Melkor, now free from the Halls of Mandos, began spreading lies amongst the \u00d1oldor attempting to corrupt them, Finw\u00eb sought to moderate his people and lead them back to the Valar. But it was too late; the \u00d1oldor had already begun to envision for themselves plans and new dominions they could rule in Middle-earth and were proud. F\u00ebanor in particular mistrusted the Valar and believed Melkor's lies. He began to hoard his treasures and would only allow his beloved father or his sons to see the Silmarils. He also began to suspect his half-brother was trying to usurp him as the favored son, and made trouble in Tirion by drawing his sword on Fingolfin. For this he was banished from the city, but Finw\u00eb loved his elder son greatly and shared his exile. They went northward and built the fortress of Formenos.\nThere Finw\u00eb lived with his son and his grandchildren and some of the rest of his house. Later, when F\u00ebanor was summoned to Valmar to make peace with Fingolfin, Finw\u00eb did not go out of bitterness over the exile of his son; nor did he wish to meet the rest of his people because he no longer felt like their king. Thus he was slain in Formenos when Melkor, seeking the Silmarils, attacked it. This act was the catalyst that led to the Revolt of the \u00d1oldor.[3][4]",

However, as a result of loosing ten men to the various hardships and affrays that occurred during his leadership, Forweg appointed scouts to watch the area around them at all times.[1]\nIn the year 484 of the First Age, Forweg's scouts caught and trailed Neithan after he entered their territory in the Forest of Brethil. Soon, Forweg had Neithan surrounded in \"a glade besides a stream\" by his armed Men. Initially, Forweg intended kill him or ransom him if possible, but after Neithan killed a luckless man who shot before the command could be given, Forweg allowed Neithan to take his place so long as he abided his commands better.[1]\nThroughout the rest of that year, Forweg, like the rest of the Gaurwaith, came to trust Neithan and praise him for his strength and skill. Yet, Forweg also feared him for his strange, impulsive anger.[1]\nSometime during the next Spring, Forweg and Andr\u00f3g had disappeared without Neithan's knowledge, and the others laughed when he asked about them. Weary of the outlaws' squalid camp, Neithan wandered far from it into the woods. Suddenly, he heard cries of a woman being chased through a hazel-thicket nearby. When her first pursuer emerged from the thicket, Neithan hewed him down, killing him, seeing as his blow struck that it was Forweg. Initially, Neithan assumed that he and Andr\u00f3g were helping the woman flee Orcs, but soon discovered that they had intended to do her harm. As such, Neithan threatened Andr\u00f3g to leave her alone or die like Forweg. As Andr\u00f3g buried Forweg and claimed his weapons, Neithan returned to the camp to inform the others of his death. Ulrad questioned how Neithan knew of Forweg's death, while Andr\u00f3g assumed that he had a grudge against Forweg. Neithan gave the Gaurwaith an ultimatum: allow him to be their new captain, or permit him to leave them.[1]\nGaurwaith\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBeleg \u2022 Algund \u2022 Andr\u00f3g \u2022 Andv\u00edr \u2022 Forweg \u2022 Orleg \u2022 T\u00farin \u2022 Ulrad\n",

Helm made Freca wait until the council ended, then marched him out of Edoras and struck him with such a blow that Freca was killed. Helm declared Wulf and Freca's near kin to be enemies of the king, and Freca's men fled to the west.[1]\nIn TA 2758, Wulf took revenge for his father's death, invading Rohan with a force of Dunlendings and enemies of Gondor while Helm was occupied with an invasion in the east of Rohan. Though Wulf occupied Edoras, and Helm and his sons died in the conflict and the Long Winter, Helm's nephew Fr\u00e9al\u00e1f ultimately killed Wulf and recaptured Edoras.[1]\nThe rift between Rohan and the Dunlendings remained over two centuries later, when many Dunlendings sided with Saruman in the War of the Ring.",

        "biography": "Early life[]\nF\u00ebanor, by Luis F. Bejarano\nF\u00ebanor was born during the Years of the Trees in Valinor to Finw\u00eb and M\u00edriel. He drew so much of M\u00edriel's life energy when he was born that she grew weary of living and her spirit voluntarily left her body, leaving her family for the Halls of Mandos. After a time, Finw\u00eb remarried and had four more children; F\u00ebanor's half-brothers Fingolfin and Finarfin, and half-sisters Findis and Irim\u00eb. Though he loved his father as dearly as a son could, F\u00ebanor was not fond of his stepmother Indis nor her children and so lived apart from her and his half-siblings. In his youth, he quickly discovered his outstanding talents for craftsmanship and language. In his youth, he improved upon the work of R\u00famil and created the system of writing known as Tengwar, used by the \u00d1oldor in Middle-earth until the Third Age. He also became a student of Mahtan, a great smith who had learned his craft at the feet of Aul\u00eb himself. From Mahtan, he learned much of metallurgy, and at some point, he wedded Mahtan's daughter Nerdanel, who bore him seven sons: Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, and Amras. He spent most of his time either alone or with his sons, such that they were all completely loyal to him. In addition to his work as a craftsman, smith, and linguist, F\u00ebanor was possessed of exceptional oratory skill, and could persuade virtually anyone through speechcraft. He also was known to have been restless, exploring as much of Aman as he could and constantly crafting new works.[2] One of these works was believed to have been the palant\u00edri.\nThe making of the Silmarils[]\nBy far the greatest of F\u00ebanor's crafting achievements was the creation of the Silmarils, also called the Great Jewels. To make them, F\u00ebanor captured some of the intermingled light from the Two Trees of Valinor and by unknown means contained it, imperishable, into three large diamond-like gems. His creations garnered him great praise, and he came to prize the Silmarils above all else. As time went on however, he began to covet the gems with a greedy love, and he increasingly ignored the fact that the light which lay in the gems and gave them their beauty was not of his own making. F\u00ebanor alternated between vainly displaying the jewels and jealously guarding them from all but his immediate family, though eventually he came to the point where they almost always remained under lock and key.[2][3]\nThe wiles of Morgoth[]\nF\u00ebanor, by kimberly80\nAfter three ages of imprisonment, Melkor, mightiest of the Valar and the world's primordial source of evil, deceived his fellows with a false show of repentance. Pardoned and residing in Valinor, his malice had in fact reached hitherto unprecedented levels, and its primary target quickly became the Elves, as it had been for their sake that he had been overthrown. He found that, of the three primary groups of Elves in Valinor, the \u00d1oldor were the easiest to manipulate due to their thirst for his knowledge and their willingness to listen. Focusing his efforts solely on the \u00d1oldor, he subtly spread lies amongst them that, amongst other things, the Valar were keeping them imprisoned in Valinor so that the race of Men might inherit Middle-earth and claim the glory that could have been theirs. Although F\u00ebanor mistrusted and feared Melkor, in his arrogance and impatience he often unwittingly repeated the lies of Melkor. F\u00ebanor quickly became the most prominent of the rebellious \u00d1oldor, to the point where the other Valar, not knowing of Melkor's influence, saw him as the source of the \u00d1oldor's distemper.\nMelkor coveted the Silmarils and hated F\u00ebanor, but cunningly hid all semblance of his true intentions as the situation continued to deteriorate. Melkor's influence eventually came to the point where rumors began to circulate amongst some that F\u00ebanor's half-brother Fingolfin was planning not only to usurp his place as heir to Finw\u00eb, but also to seize the Silmarils for himself. In his pride and vanity, F\u00ebanor took little convincing, and his hostility grew to the point to where he threatened Fingolfin with violence. The Valar, having been patient with F\u00ebanor's rabble-rousing until that point, could not ignore the transgression of breaking the peace of Valinor. F\u00ebanor was immediately summoned to the Ring of Doom to explain himself. F\u00ebanor's testimony revealed the malice of Melkor and his lies, and Tulkas immediately left the Ring to apprehend him again. Despite Melkor having been the true root of the \u00d1oldor's unrest, F\u00ebanor's crime had been of his own making, and for this the Valar exiled him for twelve years' time from Tirion. F\u00ebanor went to the stronghold of Formenos and took a substantial treasure with him, including the Silmarils, which he put in a locked box. In a show of support for his eldest son, Finw\u00eb also withdrew to Formenos and renounced the kingship so long as F\u00ebanor remained in exile.\n\"Get thee gone, and take thy due place!\" (by Jenny Dolfen)\nSometime later, Melkor unexpectedly appeared at Formenos where he tried to sway F\u00ebanor to his side, proclaiming that the Valar had treated him unjustly. However, F\u00ebanor realized that Melkor's true goal was to obtain the Silmarils, and he vehemently dismissed the fallen Vala. Melkor left in a rage and fled from Valinor. Though F\u00ebanor thought little of the incident, Finw\u00eb was filled with foreboding and reported Melkor's visit to the Valar immediately. However, they were unable to find so much as a trace of him, and after a time the Valar were forced to give up the search. Seven years later, the Valar announced a great feast at Valinor with the intention of repairing their relationship with the \u00d1oldor. F\u00ebanor's exile was temporarily rescinded, and both he and Fingolfin were invited to attend. Though the Valar had intended for Finw\u00eb to come as well, he refused the invitation of the Valar due to F\u00ebanor's continued exile and remained at Formenos. During the reconciliatory feast, Fingolfin extended a hand to his half-brother and openly recognized F\u00ebanor's place as the eldest, but it was returned by F\u00ebanor somewhat grudgingly.[2][3]\nTheft of the Silmarils[]\nF\u00ebanor wearing the Silmarils, by Baran Yenileyen\nMeanwhile, Melkor stole away to Avathar in the south of Aman. There he discovered the evil spider-like creature Ungoliant and secured her as an ally, promising to sate her unrelenting hunger in return for her aid. During the festivities at which F\u00ebanor and Fingolfin had reconciled, Melkor and Ungoliant destroyed the Two Trees and plunged Valinor into complete darkness. Melkor and Ungoliant then went to Formenos, where Melkor slew Finw\u00eb and ransacked the vault, taking the Silmarils and many other treasures. They then escaped by crossing the Helcarax\u00eb, or Grinding Ice, in the north to Beleriand in Middle-earth. Though the Valar attempted pursuit, it was ultimately in vain, for the Unlight of Ungoliant completely obscured the sight of the pursuers.\nThe Valar quickly realized that with the Trees dead, their light survived only in the Silmarils. To restore the Trees and foil Melkor's malice, Yavanna asked F\u00ebanor to give up the Silmarils so that they could be broken, and the light within them released. But F\u00ebanor emphatically stated that he would not give up his Silmarils of his own free will, and proclaimed that if the Valar forced him to do so that they would be no better than Melkor. Ultimately, F\u00ebanor's selfishness made little difference save to further darken his own heart, for a messenger from Formenos then arrived to deliver the news of Finw\u00eb's death and the theft of the Silmarils by Melkor.[4]\nThe Flight of the \u00d1oldor[]\nF\u00ebanor and his sons swear the Oath of F\u00ebanor\nF\u00ebanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of his prized Silmarils, named Melkor \"Morgoth\", or \"Black Foe of the World\" (literally \"Black Enemy\"). Consumed by rage and despair, he fled the Ring of Doom. His grief quickly turned to bitterness against the Valar themselves, and he cursed the summons which had brought him away from his father. For in his despair, he believed that had he been present at Formenos when Morgoth had come, he could have saved his father. Realistically of course the summons had saved F\u00ebanor, for though F\u00ebanor was mighty amongst his people, he was, ultimately, merely an Elf. Indeed, Morgoth had planned on killing both father and son during his break-in at Formenos, for he had possessed no prior knowledge of the Valar's festival and had assumed both would be present.\nF\u00ebanor as King, by Venlian\nNow King of the \u00d1oldor after the death of his father, F\u00ebanor returned to Tirion, ignoring the fact that he was still exiled, and gave one of the most impassioned speeches ever delivered in Arda. But due to his rage, grief, and pride, his speech was filled with many of the lies and half-truths of Morgoth. He railed against the Dark Lord, but he also blamed the Valar in part for Morgoth's deeds, claiming that they should have been able to stop him and had failed. He spoke of the fact that because Morgoth had attacked and badly marred the kingdom of the Valar without consequence to himself, there was neither bliss nor surety of safety to be found in Aman any longer. He evoked images of the kingdoms his people could build in Middle-earth, and the glory that could be theirs once they regained the Silmarils. F\u00ebanor then swore an oath by the name of Il\u00favatar himself that he would suffer none, no matter their race or reasons, to withhold a Silmaril from him, and that he would pursue with violence any who attempted it. The Oath of F\u00ebanor was also taken by his seven sons below the tower of the Mindon Eldali\u00e9va in the Great Square of Tirion. This oath became the cause for great tragedy for F\u00ebanor's family, and for the Eldar in general.\nHis impassioned speech swayed most of those present, but even with his tremendous oratory skill, dissension quickly arose regarding who should lead the hosts to Middle-earth. For though F\u00ebanor was now High King by birth, he was not well liked amongst the \u00d1oldor, and many of them were not of mind to accept his rule. Greater love was given to Fingolfin and his sons, and most of the \u00d1oldor desired greatly that Fingolfin and his sons should go with them and lead them. Fingolfin had little desire to go, but he had sworn to uphold his brother's rights as the eldest, and furthermore he did not wish to leave his people to the mercy of F\u00ebanor's rash, self serving tendencies. Additionally, his son Fingon vehemently wished to undertake the journey, and urged his father to come along. Thus against his wisdom, Fingolfin would lead a second host, larger and not so eager to leave as F\u00ebanor's, while Finarfin would command a third host, the smallest and most reluctant of the three. However even with the sons of Finw\u00eb leading the way, about a tenth of the \u00d1oldor chose simply to stay in Tirion, some for the love of Tirion and others for love of the Valar.[4][5]\nThe First Kinslaying[]\nThe battle in which the \u00d1oldor attacked the Teleri (by Ted Nasmith)\nAfter delivering his speech and departing with his host, F\u00ebanor's mood cooled somewhat, and he belatedly realized that he had no practical means of transporting himself and his people to Middle-earth. Though Middle-earth and Aman were connected in those days by the Helcarax\u00eb, a treacherous and bitterly cold region of shifting arctic ice, it was deemed to be effectively impassable. Though Morgoth and the newly empowered Ungoliant had sped across it during their escape from Valinor, even F\u00ebanor was not so rash as to believe that the \u00d1oldor could accomplish any similar feat. He then gave some thought to the building of ships, but knew that there were no shipwrights amongst his people and even had there been, crafting a fleet large enough to ferry all of the \u00d1oldor hosts to Middle-earth would have been an utterly monumental task. F\u00ebanor therefore went to Alqualond\u00eb where the seafaring Teleri lived and attempted to persuade them to join him or failing that, to secure the use of their ships. But even F\u00ebanor's impeccable wordcraft was for naught, as the Teleri had no desire whatsoever to leave Aman and would not be persuaded for any potential glory or adventure. Nor would they give F\u00ebanor their ships, for they held them too dearly. F\u00ebanor angrily cited that the Teleri owed the \u00d1oldor for instructing them in the arts of crafting buildings and cities. But Olw\u00eb, the lord of the Teleri, was unmoved, and in friendship he urged F\u00ebanor not to return to Middle-earth.\nThe Crossing of the Helcaraxe by Ted Nasmith\nBut F\u00ebanor would not take no for an answer. He understood that many of his people had been inflamed by his impassioned words and knew that haste was essential to keep cooler heads from swaying the \u00d1oldor to a more reasonable course. As such, he persuaded his host to aid him in taking the ships by force. This he attempted, but the Teleri resisted, casting many of the \u00d1oldor into the sea and thrice driving them back despite being far more lightly armed than the \u00d1oldor. However, Fingolfin's host, larger and less eager to undertake the journey, had been slower in departing Tirion than had F\u00ebanor's host. Following after F\u00ebanor, the vanguard led by Fingon came upon the battle after F\u00ebanor's host had been pushed back for the third time. Assuming that the Teleri had been the aggressors, perhaps even on the orders of the Valar themselves, Fingolfin's host joined the battle and the Teleri were overcome. Their ships were stolen, and many of the Teleri mariners were wickedly slain. However, the \u00d1oldor did not escape unscathed by any means. In addition to taking significant losses during the battle, Oss\u00eb, who loved the Teleri dearly, conjured terrible storms in vengeance for them. Many of the stolen ships were wrecked in these storms, and their \u00d1oldor crews drowned.\nA short while after the battle, as the \u00d1oldor neared the Helcarax\u00eb, they encountered a shrouded figure who may well have been Mandos himself. This figure uttered a terrible Doom, exiling the \u00d1oldor from Valinor and foretelling that their war against Morgoth would cause them only misery. Due to their wickedness in slaughtering their kin, they would be utterly forsaken in the eyes of the Valar and would receive neither welcome nor aid from Valinor in their struggles. Additionally, F\u00ebanor and his house were cursed, and Mandos foretold great suffering, and hardship would be their lot, due in no small part to the oath they had taken to regain the Silmarils at all costs. Above all, the figure made it explicitly clear that any war made by the \u00d1oldor against Morgoth would be entirely without hope; for Elves, no matter how mighty, simply did not possess the power to overcome a Vala. Upon hearing this Doom, Finarfin and his host turned back in grief, cursing F\u00ebanor.[See Note] They had not participated in the Kinslaying and as such were pardoned by the Valar when they returned. They were gladly accepted back into Tirion by their remaining kin, whereafter Finarfin ruled as High-King of the \u00d1oldor in Aman.\nF\u00ebanor however defied the Doom and proceeded onward, accompanied by Fingolfin and the two remaining hosts. As such the journey northward continued, the land became ever darker, and as the \u00d1oldor drew ever closer to the Helcarax\u00eb, the temperature began to precipitously drop. It was at this point that many of the \u00d1oldor began to openly express dissatisfaction with F\u00ebanor's leadership. Many of them had been reluctant to accept his kingship to begin with, and now the Kinslaying and the Doom had significantly decreased their tolerance for his belligerence. Additionally, the current situation presented a number of more practical issues. Not only were many of the \u00d1oldor suffering terribly from the arctic cold, but it had become clear that the storms of Oss\u00eb had wrecked too many of the ships to bear all of the \u00d1oldor at once to Middle-earth. However, the Doom of Mandos had kindled fear of treachery in the hearts of the \u00d1oldor, and none were willing to be left in Aman while others crossed the sea first. F\u00ebanor was all too aware of both the dissatisfaction of his people and the problem that lay in ferrying all of them to Middle-earth, and he sought counsel with his sons.\nF\u00ebanor watches the burning of the Teleri boats\nDuring this meeting, it came to light that F\u00ebanor's most loyal forces had incidentally maintained sole control of the Teleri fleet after having seized it. As such, F\u00ebanor decided to simply abandon in Aman all those whose loyalty to him was not absolute, and he and his followers slipped away one night in the ships. They arrived at Losgar, in the land of Lammoth, in the far west of Beleriand, where Morgoth and Ungoliant had passed not long before. Upon arriving, F\u00ebanor's eldest son Maedhros at once asked who would return upon the ships to ferry the rest of their people, but F\u00ebanor contemptuously decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingolfin behind. This action was looked upon poorly by Maedhros, but he did not speak his mind to his father, and simply watched in stony silence as the ships burned. As the world was flat in those days, the remaining \u00d1oldor saw the far distant glow of the flames, and perceived that they were betrayed. Fingolfin now had the choice of either returning to Tirion in disgrace or proceeding to Middle-earth across the treacherous and deadly Helcarax\u00eb. Fingolfin and his people chose to attempt the crossing, as many of Fingolfin's host wished to continue and many, including Fingolfin himself, were eager to confront F\u00ebanor and his people over their betrayal. In addition, and unlike the host of Finarfin, Fingolfin's host had unwittingly participated in the Kinslaying, and they did not know how they might be judged if they were to return to the realm of the Valar. The journey across the Grinding Ice was a long and terrible one, and Fingolfin's host suffered great loss of life along the way, adding to the bitterness that the survivors felt for F\u00ebanor and his sons.[5]\nFinal battle and death[]\nF\u00ebanor faces Gothmog, by CK G\u00f6ksoy\nLearning of the \u00d1oldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies from his fortress of Angband and attacked F\u00ebanor's encampment in Mithrim. This confrontation was called the Battle under the Stars, or Dagor-nuin-Giliath, for the Sun and Moon had not yet been made. Though the \u00d1oldor were caught completely by surprise, they won the battle handily, for the light of Valinor was still fresh within them. But F\u00ebanor, exhilarated by his victory and ever prideful, thought to come upon Morgoth himself and pursued the Orcs. He took with him only a small vanguard, and he and his men ventured far ahead of the main \u00d1oldor force. As F\u00ebanor and his band approached the Gates of Angband, the fleeing Orcs noted the small size of the Elven force and turned and gave battle. The engagement's proximity to Angband saw a number of Balrogs emerge to aid the Orcs, and they quickly slew most of the Elves. Despite this, F\u00ebanor was undaunted, and he long fought on alone despite being dealt many wounds. At last, however, he was stricken to the ground by Gothmog, the Lord of Balrogs.\nFortunately for F\u00ebanor, his sons arrived with a substantial relief force. The Balrogs and the remaining Orcs returned to Angband, and F\u00ebanor's sons took him from the battlefield. However, F\u00ebanor knew that his wounds were mortal, and bade his sons to stop. He looked upon Angband and cursed Morgoth thrice, but gazing upon the sheer scope of Morgoth's stronghold, he understood at last the truth of Mandos's words; no force of the \u00d1oldor ever could or would overthrow the Dark Lord. Nevertheless, he instructed his sons to keep to their oath and avenge their father. As he died, his fiery spirit left his body and burned it to ash.\nDespite being an Elf, F\u00ebanor was never seen again in the world. His immortal spirit has never left the Halls of Mandos, and has remained there ever since it arrived. He has not been reborn into a new body to once again walk amongst the Elves or the Valar in Valinor, like the rest of the Elves could do. Whether this fact is by the will of the Valar due to his offensive deeds in the latter part of his life, or by choice has never been explained and thus remains unknown.[5]\nLegacy[]\nMaedhros casts himself and his Silmaril into the earth\nMaglor casts his Silmaril into the sea\nOn F\u00ebanor's passing, his son Maedhros became High King of the \u00d1oldor. Maedhros, however was a prisoner of Morgoth, but was freed by Fingon. Maedhros therefore, out of a desire to keep his people united, and an acknowledgement that, as Finw\u00eb's oldest surviving son, the kingship ought to pass to him by right of birth, renounced the throne in favor of Fingolfin. This acknowledgement had the unifying effect that Maedhros desired, and eliminated the possibility of more internal strife amongst the \u00d1oldor's royal Houses.[6] Fingolfin's descendants would reign over the \u00d1oldor until the death of Gil-galad many centuries later. F\u00ebanor's deeds, many of which were infamously despicable, cast a shadow over the interactions between the Sindar and the returning \u00d1oldor. For Thingol, the King of Doriath, eventually learned of the Kinslaying, the burning of the ships at Losgar, and the curse of Mandos. As the Teleri were of Thingol's own kin, he was enraged to hear of the merciless and needless slaughter. The sons of Finarfin he came to forgive, as they were of his own kin and had not participated in the evil. Those of Fingolfin's host, who had endured the horror of crossing the Helcarax\u00eb after F\u00ebanor's betrayal, he held as having suffered enough hardship to redress their ills. But all those who had followed F\u00ebanor, were of his kin, or were friends of his kin, Thingol held in contempt and would have as little to do with as he could. F\u00ebanor's remaining sons were still bound by the Oath to recover the Silmarils, and this oath would eventually see two more Kinslayings come to pass, each more horrific than the last, and would work to undermine the Elven war against Morgoth in many important ways. E\u00e4rendil's fate was to eternally traverse the Great Ocean with the Silmaril that Beren and L\u00fathien had wrested from Morgoth and guard the Sun and Moon. After the War of Wrath, Maglor and his last surviving brother Maedhros stole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the Valar from Morgoth, even though initially Maglor tried to dissuade his older brother from doing this. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor and Maedhros's hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maedhros cast himself and the Silmaril he carried into a fiery chasm in the Earth. Unable to bear the suffering, Maglor cast his Silmaril into the sea. Thereafter, he wandered along the shores of the world singing laments over the loss of the Silmaril, until he faded from memory, though the circumstances and date of his death, if it ever happened at all, are unknown.\nThe inscription on the door to Moria, with interpretation\nF\u00ebanor's hammer in The Rings of Power, in which it is used by Celebrimbor\nF\u00ebanor's grandson Celebrimbor, son of Curufin, repented of his family's actions and would remain in Middle-earth into the Second Age, where he founded the realm of Eregion. Like F\u00ebanor, Celebrimbor would be a great smith and helped create the Doors of Durin in Khazad-d\u00fbm, which would later bear the emblem of the House of F\u00ebanor: a single star with many rays. However, Celebrimbor, who also created the Rings of Power, would later be killed by Sauron, ending F\u00ebanor's line.",

        "history": "Elder Days\nLife in Aman\nGaladriel was born in Eldamar in the year 1362 of the Years of the Trees.[10] She was the fourth child of Finarfin, prince of the \u00d1oldor, who named her Artanis.[11] Her mother was E\u00e4rwen, princess of the Teleri, who named her Nerwen. Galadriel grew beautiful and tall, even for the women of the \u00d1oldor. Being strong of body, will, and mind, she was \"a match for both the loremasters and the athletes of the Eldar in the days of their youth\".[12]\n\"Galadriel\" by Marya Filatova\nIndeed, \"she was then of Amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats\". This custom was the origin of her Sindarin name Galadriel,[13] which was given to, and accepted by, her much later in Beleriand.[14] The gleaming of her hair was not a mere poetic reference: her hair was held to be an unmatched marvel. It mingled and surpassed the gold hair of her father and the starlike silver of her mother, so the Eldar said that both lights of the Two Trees of Valinor were captured in her tresses. It was also said that this first gave the idea to her uncle F\u00ebanor of capturing the merged light of the Trees, which would result in the making of the Silmarils. He once asked her three times for one of her tresses, but she always refused. F\u00ebanor and Galadriel were always unfriends, both being the greatest Eldar in Valinor; and if F\u00ebanor was greater than she, she was wiser, and her wisdom grew with the long years. For she also had an outstanding gift to see into the minds of others, and, though she judged most with kindness, she hated and feared the darkness in F\u00ebanor, not perceiving that the shadow of the same evil had fallen upon the minds of all the \u00d1oldor, including her own.[12]\nThere was still bliss in Valinor when she was born, but soon she was influenced by the unrest of the \u00d1oldor and afterwards lost her inner peace. She was proud, like most of the House of Finw\u00eb, and like her closest brother Finrod, \"she had dreams of far lands and dominions that might be her own to order as she would without tutelage\". But deep in herself, she had the noble spirit of the Vanyar, which did not allow her to forget the reverence for the Valar.[12]\nDuring the rebellion of F\u00ebanor and the beginning of the Long Night, Galadriel was the only woman of the \u00d1oldor who stood among the rising princes. Though she swore no oath, the words of F\u00ebanor concerning Middle-earth still kindled a desire in her heart, as she was eager to see those wide unguarded lands and rule a realm of her own.[15] Like the rest of the House of Finarfin, she was also supportive of the Exile by the desire to aid their Sindarin relatives in Middle-earth.[12]\nGaladriel, by Maria Dimova.\nGaladriel witnessing the kinslaying at Alqualond\u00eb, by Elena Kukanova\nEven though she was one of the leaders in this revolt,[16] during the troubles that followed she fought fiercely against F\u00ebanor by defending her mother's kin during the Kinslaying at Alqualond\u00eb and the rape of the ships. Afterwards, she even desired to follow F\u00ebanor to disturb him in all the ways that she could, but nothing could have moved her to return since she had begun her way to exile, as her pride was strong then as it was thereafter.[12] She kept moving forward even under the Doom of Mandos, when her father Finarfin abandoned the march and returned to Valinor, and even when F\u00ebanor left behind the hosts of Fingolfin and the children of Finarfin. Then she, along with Finrod and Fingolfin and his sons, led her people far into the bitter North and crossed the terrors of the Helcarax\u00eb. After many losses, they arrived on the northern shores of the Outer Lands.[15]\nArrival to Middle-earth\nOnce in Beleriand, those of the House of Finarfin were eager to enter Menegroth in Doriath, but King Elu Thingol received the \u00d1oldor coldly, and only allowed entrance to those invited by him after some inquiries.[17] Finally in the year 52 of the First Age,[18] Finrod and Galadriel became long guests in Doriath, but her brother eventually departed to the caverns of Narog to establish the stronghold of Nargothrond. Galadriel did not go with him, and remained in Doriath with Celeborn, a kinsman of Thingol, as there was great love between them.[19] Despite their love, they did not marry each other, following the custom among the Eldar of avoiding marriage and child-bearing during the war,[20] but they were eventually betrothed till the war ended.[21] Meanwhile, she dwelt with Queen Melian, from whom she learned much of the wisdom of Middle-earth.[17]\n\"Artanis and F\u00ebanor\" by TolmanCotton on DeviantArt\nThe Western Corn necessary to make lembas had been lost in Beleriand until the \u00d1oldor brought new grain back, and it flourished by the grace of the Valar. Galadriel was one of the main inheritors of it and of the art of the making of lembas.[22] It is safe to assume Melian benefited from this.\nYears passed in Doriath, and Galadriel became dear to Melian, and they spoke often to one another about Valinor. Melian was eager to learn the causes of the Exile of the \u00d1oldor, but Galadriel would tell her nothing of what occurred after the death of the Trees. In the year 66,[23] Melian asked her directly about this, and Galadriel revealed the story of the Silmarils and how the \u00d1oldor fled from Aman against the will of the Valar, though she still left out the Oath of F\u00ebanor, the Kinslaying, and the burning of the Telerian ships at Losgar. Melian was able to discern a darkness that was left unsaid, but Galadriel refused to tell her more. Thus, Thingol became concerned regarding the \u00d1oldor, and he was informed soon afterwards of the \u00d1oldor's dark deeds in Aman, and it chanced that the children of Finarfin were visiting Galadriel in Doriath. Egged on by his accusing words, Angrod told him everything, and Galadriel's brothers departed heavy-hearted.[19]\nDespite all this, Galadriel stayed in Doriath until the year 102,[24] when the kingdom of Nargothrond was finished and a feast was held for all the children of Finarfin. She dwelt there for a while. During this time, she asked Finrod why he remained unmarried. Her brother answered with dark foresight about his kingdom.[19] Back in Doriath, in the year 420,[25] Galadriel heard another foretelling, as Melian told her about a Man who shall cross into Doriath moved by a doom greater than the Girdle of Melian.[26]\nGaladriel did not have any significant role in the general course of events in the War of the Great Jewels, but she might have been well informed of the deaths of her brothers Angrod and Aegnor during the Dagor Bragollach; and of Finrod's, while he was held in captivity by Sauron in the year 465.[27] At some point before the Fall of Nargothrond in the year 495,[28] she and Celeborn passed over the mountains[9] to Eriador, far from the turmoil of the last years of the First Age.\nAfter the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, E\u00f6nw\u00eb, herald of Manw\u00eb, summoned the Elves of Beleriand to the West, so they were received in Tol Eress\u00eba and under the pardon of the Valar. However, some did not wish to leave Middle-earth, such as Celeborn.[29] Being one of the chief leaders of the \u00d1oldorin rebellion, Galadriel was not allowed to return[30] and a ban was set upon her, to which she replied that she had no wish to do so.[16] The same pride that led her out of Aman still moved her, and she rejected the pardon of the Valar,[12] for as she had once lived in Aman itself, Eress\u00eba seemed only a \"second best\". She was also moved by love for Celeborn, to whom she probably married around this time.[20]\n\nSecond Age\nAt the beginning of the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel dwelt for a time in Lindon, south of the Lune, while Gil-galad ruled in the north.[7] Both left Lindon before the years 10-20, when Gil-galad became king in that land, apparently thanks to her influence.[31] They entered Eriador and dwelt for a while around Lake Nenuial, being followed by many \u00d1oldor, Grey-elves and Green-elves. They were considered to be the Lord and Lady of the Eldar in Eriador.[32] Probably around the year 300, Galadriel and Celeborn had a daughter: Celebr\u00edan.[20]\nAround the year 500, Sauron began to stir in Middle-earth again,[7] but his name was not known. He was, however, perceived by Galadriel, who noticed there was a controlling evil, and that it was spreading above the world, coming from the East beyond the Misty Mountains. She also thought that this \"residue of evil\" could only be fought with an alliance of all its enemies. Therefore, she and Celeborn moved eastwards and established in the realm of Eregion near Khazad-d\u00fbm. Celeborn was not fond of Dwarves, but Galadriel saw the importance of getting close to them, for she saw military interests even with them. Also, she was a \u00d1oldo, and therefore close to them in mind and in the passion for crafts; and in Valinor she had learned from Yavanna and Aul\u00eb, the creator of the Dwarves himself.[32]\nSome \u00d1oldor were also interested in establishing a realm near Khazad-d\u00fbm because they knew mithril had been discovered there. Therefore, many Elven-smiths came to Eregion and created good relations with the Dwarves. Celebrimbor, a descendant of F\u00ebanor, was the greatest of these craft-men and thus became the Lord of Eregion.[7] In 750, he was the main builder in the early construction of Ost-in-Edhil. The power of Galadriel and Celeborn also grew: thanks to the Dwarves of Khazad-d\u00fbm, they had contact with the Nandorin realm of L\u00f3rinand on the other side of the Misty Mountains. Thanks to Galadriel's influence upon L\u00f3rinand, Sauron's machinations in the Vales of Anduin were fruitless.[32] Galadriel also got in contact with N\u00famenor, having a meeting with King Aldarion when he came to the Bridge of Tharbad between the years 883-884.[33]\nGaladriel, Gil-galad, and C\u00edrdan receive the Three Rings of Power\nAround the year 1200, Sauron came in disguise to Eriador, but he was only welcomed in Eregion by Celebrimbor and the Elven-smiths, who were interested in his advice on craftsmanship.[32] Galadriel was not deceived, and rejected him, saying that he was not in the training of Aul\u00eb as he claimed.[34] While Sauron realized this immediately, he desired \"to placate her\u2026with outward patience and courtesy\" for some time. All the while, without Galadriel's knowledge, Sauron influenced Celebrimbor and the Gwaith-i-M\u00edrdain against Galadriel and Celeborn. Some time between the years 1350 and 1400, he moved them to expel Galadriel from Eregion in a coup. Thus, Galadriel and Celebr\u00edan left through Khazad-d\u00fbm to L\u00f3rinand, although Celeborn would not enter the Dwarvish realm and remained in Eregion.[32]\nWhen Sauron made the One Ring in the year 1600, his treachery was discovered by Celebrimbor.[7] The elven-smith came to L\u00f3rinand, seeking counsel from Galadriel. They did not find the strength to destroy the Rings of Power, but she advised him to hide the Three Rings of the Elves where Sauron could not find them. Therefore he gave her Nenya, the White Ring, while the other Rings were given to other Elven lords.[32] This was done in the year 1693, the same year Sauron began the war against the Elves.[7]\nWith the invasion of Eriador, Eregion was destroyed and Celebrimbor was killed. Despite using torture, Sauron could not learn from him where the Elven Rings were, although he suspected that they were kept by Galadriel and Gil-galad.[32] Thanks to the military intervention of N\u00famenor, however, Sauron was defeated in the year 1700.[7] Soon afterwards, Galadriel was affected by the Unquiet of Ulmo[35] and she decided to leave L\u00f3rinand to dwell beside the sea.[32] As one of the High-elves, her yearning for the sea was unavoidable, and now she became burdened with the desire to cross to the Blessed Realm, but the ban upon her impeded it.[16] Thus she did not go to the sea yet, but crossed west of the mountains through Khazad-d\u00fbm with Celebr\u00edan. Seeking Celeborn, they travelled to Imladris, a refuge created by Elrond during the war. Once there, a Council was held, in which it was decided that Imladris would be the Elvish stronghold in the East, rather than the desolate Eregion.[32]\nGaladriel, Celeborn, and Celebr\u00edan dwelt for a long time in Imladris, but at some point they left and moved to Belfalas near the sea at the place later known as Dol Amroth. There were a few inhabitants there, but they were visited by Nandorin parties.[32] Apparently, they returned to L\u00f3rien twice before the Last Alliance and the end of the Second Age,[36] but their whereabouts during the final millennia of that Age is untold.\nThird Age\nRule in L\u00f3rien\nIn the year 109 of the early Third Age, Galadriel and Celeborn's daughter Celebr\u00edan wedded Elrond the Half-elven.[8] The did not stay at first with her, however, for Galadriel was filled with foreboding, and was concerned about the growing shadow in Mirkwood and Dol Guldur. Therefore she and Celeborn made long journeys investigating Rhovanion, going from Gondor and the borders of Mordor to Thranduil in Northern Mirkwood. They also stayed a long time in L\u00f3rien with king Amroth, for Galadriel saw with her wisdom that this prosperous realm could be a stronghold against the growing Shadow, if it had better rule.[36] At this point, the Order of Wizards arrived in Middle-earth, and only Galadriel, Elrond, and C\u00edrdan knew where they came from.[6] Around the year 1100, the Wise, including Galadriel as one the chief Eldar, were well aware of the evil dwelling in Dol Guldur, but thought it was one of the Nazg\u00fbl.[8]\nAfter their enquiries, Galadriel and Celeborn passed over the mountains to Imladris, and there dwelt for many years with their kin.[36]\nBetween the years 1980 and 1981, a terror appeared in Khazad-d\u00fbm and the Dwarves abandoned the realm, while the many Silvan Elves from L\u00f3rien had to flee south.[8] To make things worse, Amroth was lost, leaving no heir, and the Elven realm was left without a ruler. Therefore Celeborn and Galadriel went there, welcomed by the people, and took up the rule jointly, but refused to take the royal title and were called the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim instead. Saving the realm from the perils of the moment, they dwelt and ruled permanently there.[36]\nAs the shadow of Dol Guldur grew again, the White Council was formed in the year 2463.[8] It was summoned by Galadriel,[9] who, being a good friend of Gandalf, recommended that he be made head of the Council. But this distinction fell instead to Saruman.[6]\nIn the year 2510, her daughter Celebr\u00edan departed to the West after being wounded by Orcs.[8] That same year, she aided Eorl and his riders in the Battle of the Field of Celebrant by creating a white mist that drove out the shadows from Dol Guldur, unintentionally causing their descendants to regard her and the Golden Wood with fear.[37]\nThe White Council would not take action until Gandalf discovered that the shadow growing in Dol Guldur was Sauron. After deliberating, the Council joined forces and drove Sauron out of Dol Guldur in the year 2941.[8]\nSome years later, Aragorn II entered Lothl\u00f3rien after many travels, and was admitted by Galadriel. She bade him to change his worn-out clothes and dressed him like a proper prince. During that time, Aragorn became betrothed to her granddaughter Arwen.[38]\nWar of the Ring\nGaladriel at her Mirror, motioning to Frodo and Sam, by Ivan Cavini\nGaladriel and Celeborn were well informed about the Company of the Ring, its members, and their mission, before its coming to Lothl\u00f3rien, perhaps informed by messages from Rivendell.[39] In the evening of January 17 in the year 3019, the Company arrived at Caras Galadhon.[40] Coming to the talan of the Lady and Lord, each member was greeted by name by Celeborn. Noticing that Gandalf was missing, Galadriel asked where he was, for she wished to speak with him. Hearing that they had encountered Durin's Bane and that this was in fact a Balrog from ancient times, Celeborn criticized the passing of the Company through Moria. However, Galadriel was more sympathetic, especially towards Gimli, who bowed to her in respect. Before inviting the members of the Company to rest and heal there, she looked deep into their eyes and they all felt their hearts exposed.[9]\nGaladriel shows Frodo and Sam her mirror - by Ted Nasmith\nA month later, on February 15,[40] Frodo Baggins the bearer of the One Ring, was walking in the evening with Samwise Gamgee when they encountered Galadriel. She led them to an enclosed garden and showed them a silver basin. Filling it with water, a mirror was formed, which allowed them to see things that were and that might come. Frodo saw the Eye of Sauron, and she explained that she knew Frodo's mind well, for Sauron also tried to look into hers. She also kept a Ring of Power. Showing him Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, she explained that its power would disappear once Frodo destroyed the One, and L\u00f3rien would fade. When Frodo offered the One Ring to her, she laughed in response, saying that she \"greatly desired\" it. However, she then began to ponder how powerful she would become with the Ring's power, and as a result, a great light from Nenya covered her overwhelming height. After the light faded and she laughed again, she told Frodo that she had passed \"the test\" and that she would \"diminish\u2026into the West\".[9] Indeed, with this rejection of temptation and her long opposition against Sauron, the ban upon her return to Aman was finally lifted.[16]\nGaladriel filling the Mirror in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring film\nThat night, the Lord and Lady summoned the Company and spoke of their departure, which was appointed for the following morning. The next day, she sent the Fellowship off on their Quest, furnished with gifts for all the members, including lembas and Elven cloaks. Later, a farewell party was held, which the Lord and Lady attended in a swan boat; from it, Galadriel sang a song about Eldamar. After everyone ate and drank, she proceed to give specific gifts to each member.[41]\nGaladriel depicted by Stephen Hickman\nAmong the gifts was the Elfstone, which she gave to Aragorn from Arwen \"as a token of hope\".[41] The jewel was also in part a bridal gift and a token of the future wedding of Arwen and Aragorn, done following the Noldorin custom in which the bride's mother should give to the bridegroom a jewel. Since Arwen's mother Celebr\u00edan had departed long ago, Galadriel did it in her place.[42] When Galadriel stated that she was unsure as to what to give to Gimli, she asked what he wanted. After complimenting her beauty due to being touched by her nobility and beauty, he asked for a single strand of her hair. Instead, she generously gifted him three strands, which he promised to put into an imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of his house in memory of her. Apart from the strands of hair given to Gimli and the Elfstone to Aragorn, she gave a Mallorn seed and a small box of earth from her garden to Samwise Gamgee and a belt each to Boromir, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took. To Legolas she gave a long, stout bow of the Galadhrim. And last, to Frodo, she gave a a small crystal phial specially prepared by her, which contained the light of Gil-Orestel. As the Fellowship departed, the Company saw her one last time while sailing down to the Anduin: a shining figure, all clad in white, raising her arms, and Frodo was able to hear her clearly reciting a long poem in Elvish despite the distance.[41]\nGaladriel as Lady of L\u00f3rien, as seen by Ralph Damiani\nThe following day, a resurrected Gandalf was brought the peak of Celebdil to L\u00f3rien by Gwaihir,[40] who was sent by Galadriel. He was received in Caras Galadhon, and was healed and clothed in white. He also took and gave counsel. Before he left, Galadriel gave him some prophetic messages for Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli.[43]\nThe land of L\u00f3rien was not exempt from the battles of the War of the Ring: between March 11 and March 18, the Galadhrim suffered three assaults from Dol Guldur.[40] After the Downfall of Barad-d\u00fbr, Celeborn crossed the Anduin with a host and began the destruction of Dol Guldur.[44] Soon afterward, Galadriel threw down the walls of the fortress and opened its pits.[40]\nLater history\nGaladriel, her husband Celeborn, and Elrond about to leave for Valinor\nGaladriel, Celeborn, and their company attended the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen in Minas Tirith. Soon afterward they joined the crowded funeral riding of King Th\u00e9oden to Rohan. After the funerals in the Golden Hall, they continued their travel northwards with other companions and halted in Isengard. Treebeard revealed that he had freed Saruman, and regretted that he would not see Galadriel and Celeborn again. Celeborn replied that he was unsure, but Galadriel affirmed that it would be her last meeting with him, giving Treebeard some cryptic words concerning Arda Envinyanta[45]. They continued on their way and encountered Saruman, who, released by Treebeard, snapped that she had always hated him, and that he would find comfort now knowing that her realm was destroyed as well as his.[46]\nTwo years later, on September 22 of the year 3021,[44] Frodo and Sam encountered a Wandering Company while traveling around The Shire, and found that Elrond, Galadriel, and Bilbo Baggins were a part of it. Nenya was visible on Galadriel's finger, and she seemed to shine like the moon. Frodo decided to depart with them and the hobbits joined the company led by Elrond and Galadriel.[47] On September 29, they reached Mithlond and departed over the sea at the very end of the Third Age.[44]\nSometime later during the Fourth Age, she received Celeborn, her husband.[48] In the year 120,[49] it is said that Gimli sailed to the West alongside Legolas out of his desire to see Galadriel again. He may have been allowed thanks to her intervention.[50]\n"

He was very fond of his wine. One evening in TA 2941, Galion tempted the chief of the guards into testing some Dorwinion wine with him. As a consequence, he fell asleep with the chief of the guards. This allowed the hobbit to steal the keys and release Thorin and Company from the king's dungeon. When some Elves returned from the king's feast, they found Galion and woke him up. When they noted the heaviness of some of the seemingly empty barrels, Galion ordered them to push the barrels into the water without question.[1]",

He had many brothers and sisters. A gardener by trade, Sam seemed to be a simple Hobbit of plain speech. However, his love for Elves, his gift for poetry, and his belief that the world contained greater wonders than most hobbits were aware of (all nurtured by his tutor Bilbo Baggins) set him apart from the beginning. It was Sam who first introduced (in J.R.R. Tolkien's novels) the theme of the Elves sailing from Middle-earth, a subtle foreshadowing of Bilbo and Frodo's final journey across the sea from the Grey Havens. He lived with his father, Hamfast Gamgee, known commonly as \"The Gaffer\", on Bagshot Row in the Shire, close to Bag End. He had five siblings: Hamson, Halfred, Daisy, May, and Marigold.\nSam with Bill the Pony, before the four hobbits had reached Bree, by Anna Kulisz\nQuest of the Ring\nAs \"punishment\" for eavesdropping on Gandalf's conversation with Frodo regarding the dangers of the One Ring while trimming the grass of Bag End, Gandalf chose Sam to be Frodo's companion on his journey to Rivendell. Sam saved Frodo's life more than once during the quest to destroy the Ring, and would accompany him all the way to Mount Doom.\nSamwise gardening at Bag End, found by Gandalf to be eavesdropping, drawn by TolmanCotton\nAfter leaving Bree, Sam became very close to the pony Bill. On arrival at the Doors of Durin Bill had to be set loose as he could not pass through the Mines of Moria. This caused Sam great distress. In Lothl\u00f3rien Sam was given a gift by the Lady Galadriel; a small box containing soil from her garden along with a Mallorn seed.\nAfter Shelob attacked and seemingly killed Frodo, Sam took the Ring, intending to complete the quest on his own. Because he held the Ring for a time, he was considered one of the Ring-bearers and during the time he possessed it the Ring tempted him with visions of a great garden all for himself. Being humble, Sam never gave into the treacherous visions and temptations of the Ring, and returned it when he discovered Frodo alive in the Tower of Cirith Ungol.[1] He and Bilbo were the only ones ever to have given up the Ring willingly, and only Sam surrendered it readily.\nSam admiring some flowers\nWhen Orcs took Frodo's body, Sam overheard one of them saying that Frodo was still alive, so he followed them into the Tower of Cirith Ungol, determined to rescue Frodo. Once there he found that competing bands of Uruks and Morgul Orcs had rioted and killed one another over the possession of Frodo's Mithril coat, thus making it easier for Sam to get to Frodo and escape the tower with him.\nSam and Frodo made their way to Mount Doom, disguised as Orcs along the way. The way to Mount Doom was filled with fiery rocks and pillows of ash which made it almost impossible for the hobbits to pass. When Frodo collapsed from weakness, Sam carried him up the slopes of Mount Doom, only to be stopped by Gollum. Sam delayed Gollum while Frodo continued towards the Cracks of Doom. Sam then rushed to follow Frodo, only to see Frodo renounce the quest and claim the Ring as his own, putting it on his finger. Unbeknownst to Sam, Gollum had followed in his tracks, and attacked him from behind. In the moments while Sam was dazed, Gollum attacked Frodo, and after a brief struggle took the Ring by force by biting off Frodo's finger. Gollum began to celebrate regaining the Ring, but in doing so slipped and fell to his death in the fiery chasm below, destroying the Ring in the process.[2]\nThe destruction of the Ring triggered a violent upheaval of Mount Doom, but with Sam's assistance, the two hobbits escaped from Sammath Naur onto the mountainside. Though they attempted to descend, the hobbits were trapped by the issue of lava and fiery ash from the mountain. Before the fire reached them, however, Gwaihir the Lord of the Great Eagles, come at the behest of Gandalf, spotted the hobbits from afar. Landroval and Meneldor, Gwaihir's companions, rescued Sam and Frodo and flew them to the safety of Ithilien.[3]\nSam carries Frodo to the entrance of Mount Doom\nSam and Frodo were healed of their wounds, while still unconscious, by Aragorn upon reaching Ithilien. Sam awoke, to his surprise, to find Gandalf watching over him. Gandalf led Sam and Frodo to the Field of Cormallen, where they were met by a large crowd, who praised the hobbits in many tongues for their heroism and sacrifice. There they met also Aragorn, who revealed himself to the hobbits as the true King of Gondor and Arnor. In the following days, Frodo and Sam were reunited with the surviving members of the Fellowship, and at length, those assembled traveled to Minas Tirith for Aragorn's coronation.[3]\nSome months afterwards, Sam, along with a great company including Aragorn, Gandalf, Galadriel, and the other hobbits, left Minas Tirith, traveling towards the Shire by way of Rohan, Isengard, and Rivendell. All but Gandalf left them by the time the company reached Rivendell, and from there the four hobbits returned to the Shire.[4][5] Upon reaching their native country, however, they found it to be usurped by Ruffians and unfriendly hobbits under the rule of Lotho Sackville-Baggins, who had begun the process of turning the Shire into an industrial center. Sam, Frodo, Merry, and Pippin played an instrumental role in what afterwards became known as the Scouring of the Shire, in which the Shire was freed from its ruinous occupation by Ruffians. It was also discovered that Lotho was in fact a puppet of Saruman, who had come north to play his last bit of mischief. Both met their demise in the events prior to and following the Battle of Bywater.[6]\nAfter the War of the Ring\nSam and Rosie at their wedding\nFollowing the Scouring of the Shire, Sam married Rose (Rosie) Cotton. They had thirteen children: Elanor the Fair, Frodo, Rose, Merry, Pippin, Goldilocks, Hamfast, Daisy, Primrose, Bilbo, Ruby, Robin, and Tolman. When Frodo Baggins announced that he was leaving to the Undying Lands, west of Middle-earth, he gave Sam the Red Book of Westmarch and Bag End where he and his large personal family, later called the Gardners, would live for many years.[7] After Will Whitfoot resigned his post as Mayor of Michel Delving, in SR 1427, Sam was elected Mayor of the Shire for seven consecutive seven-year terms.\nSam with Elanor, Rosie & his son Frodo\nLater years\nAfter his wife died in the year 61 of the Fourth Age (SR 1482), Sam, at the age of 102, entrusted the Red Book to his daughter, Elanor, and left the Shire. It was a tradition handed down from Elanor that he went to the Grey Havens, and because he was also a Ring-bearer (albeit for a short time), he was allowed to pass over the Sea to be reunited with Frodo in the Undying Lands.[8]\n",

During the battle, Gamling heard Gimli's warning that Orcs had entered a culvert under the Deeping Wall and led the Men of the Westfold in a charge that drove the Orcs back.\nGamling then asked Gimli to help block up the opening with small boulders and broken stones. However, Saruman's army later breached the Deeping Wall using an explosive device. Gamling then retreated into the Deep with Gimli, where they defended the narrows before the entrance to the Glittering Caves until dawn, when Gandalf and \u00c9omer arrived with reinforcements and the Battle of the Hornburg was won.[2]",

        "biography": "First Age[]\nGil-galad was born in YT 1481 in Eldamar as the son of Orodreth and grandson of Angrod and E\u00f0ellos, thus tying him into the House of Finarfin.[2][3] He was still relatively young during the times of the Exile of the \u00d1oldor and such battles as Dagor Bragollach and N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad. His father ruled Minas Tirith on Tol Sirion, but shortly before its fall by the forces of Sauron, Orodreth send his wife and son to the Havens of the Falas into C\u00edrdan the Shipwright's care. Gil-galad lived there until Morgoth destroyed the Havens after the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and Gil-galad and C\u00edrdan escaped to the Isle of Balar with the rest of the Falathrim.\nAfter the death of Turgon during the Fall of Gondolin, Gil-galad received the Kingship of the \u00d1oldor.[5] When the Sons of F\u00ebanor committed the Third Kinslaying, Gil-galad received word of the sacking of the Havens of Sirion, but he and his host arrived too late to stop the F\u00ebanorians, who fled after the battle was over. However the survivors of Sirion joined with Gil-galad and went with him to Balar, where they told him of Elrond and Elros' captivity. After the War of Wrath, the remaining Sons of F\u00ebanor vanished out of history. Maedhros committed suicide while Maglor disappeared without a trace, leaving Elrond and Elros alone. Therefore at some point Gil-galad welcomed Elrond into his ranks as his herald, after the latter chose to be one of Elf-kind.\nSecond Age[]\nHigh King of the Noldor, by MellorianJ\nIn year 1 of the Second Age, Gil-galad remained in Middle-earth and established a realm in Lindon, which was geographically strong and secure against enemies. At its height, his realm extended eastward as far as the Misty Mountains and the western parts of\u00a0Greenwood the Great, though most of the Eldar remained in Lindon and in Elrond's refuge of Rivendell.\nGil-galad had an alliance with the Men of Westernesse, especially with Tar-Aldarion (the Mariner), the Faithful and Elendil. Gil-galad reigned as High King of the \u00d1oldor throughout the Second Age. During this time Gil-galad was given the seeds of mellyrn by Tar-Aldarion, King of N\u00famenor. But the seeds wouldn't grow in his land so he gave them to Galadriel before she left Lindon. She carried these seeds for a long time, finally planting them in Lind\u00f3rinand ('Golden Valley'). When they grew there it was renamed Laurelind\u00f3renan ('Land of the Valley of Singing Gold'). At some point, Gil-galad and Elrond were approached by a stranger called Annatar, who called himself the Lord of Gifts. Fair seeming were his words and offerings, but Gil-galad perceived that this Annatar was not what he seemed. Therefore he refused to have dealings with him, and sent word abroad to all the Elves that they should shun this stranger.\nGil-galad's halls, in Lindon, imagined by Ralph Damiani\nHowever Annatar was received in Eregion, where he taught the Elves how to make the Rings of Power. But Gil-galad's distrust was proven correct, as Annatar was Sauron in disguise, and the rings were tools for his wicked plans to dominate Middle-earth. Later on, Gil-galad\u00a0was entrusted by Celebrimbor with the Elven Rings\u00a0Vilya (Ring of Air) and Narya\u00a0(Ring of Fire), two of the Three Rings, which he passed on to his herald Elrond and his lieutenant C\u00edrdan prior to his demise in the War of the Last Alliance.[6]\nSauron invaded Eriador in great force in the War of the Elves and Sauron, destroying Eregion and laying siege to the Grey Havens. But Gil-galad was aided by the N\u00famen\u00f3reans, then ruled by Tar-Minastir, who sent a great fleet which defeated the Dark Lord's forces. Sauron, who barely escaped with a bodyguard, returned to Mordor, where he laid low, gathering his strength, plotting vengeance against the D\u00fanedain. Over a thousand years later Sauron was again confronted by the N\u00famen\u00f3reans and brought back as a prisoner to their homeland, leaving Gil-galad free to rule Middle-earth in peace. In Sauron's absence, Gil-galad's power grew to the point where Sauron was dismayed when he returned from the ruin of N\u00famenor. Yet the survivors of N\u00famenor, known as the The Faithful, arrived in Middle-earth and established the Realms in Exile, with Gil-galad befriending the High King Elendil and building for him the three towers on the Tower Hills. A century later when Sauron attacked Gondor, Elendil and Gil-galad took counsel as to how they should deal with him. At length they decided to gather all of their hosts and attack Sauron before he could recover his strength, forming the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.\nGil-galad at the Siege of Barad-d\u00fbr as shown in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\nThe two kings spent several years training and assembling their forces before meeting at Amon S\u00fbl. Crossing the Misty Mountains they were joined by Oropher of the Greenwood, Amd\u00edr of L\u00f3rien and Durin IV of Khazad-d\u00fbm. Gil-galad's famed weapon was a spear named Aeglos\u00a0- which meant \"Icicle\"; none could withstand it. Joining up with the army of Gondor led by An\u00e1rion, the Army of the Last Alliance confronted Sauron's forces in the Battle of Dagorlad, a long and bloody battle which ultimately resulted in victory for the Alliance. The Elves and Men then passed through into Mordor and laid siege to Barad-d\u00fbr for seven years. Eventually Sauron emerged and Gil-galad\u00a0and Elendil then duelled the Dark Lord. During their struggle, Gil-galad and Elendil inflicted enough mortal wounds on the Dark Lord to destroy his body, though they received terrible wounds in return. This sacrifice allowed Isildur to sever the Ring from the Dark Lord's hand. But Gil-galad received severe burns from \"the heat of Sauron's hand\", and so he passed on to the Halls of Mandos. He was not known to have a wife, nor any children, so the kingship of the \u00d1oldor ended in Middle-earth and C\u00edrdan was from then on the Lord of the Grey Havens and Lindon.[7][8]\nGil-galad was an Elven-king.\nOf him the harpers sadly sing;\nthe last whose realm was fair and free\nbetween the Mountains and the Sea.\n\nHis sword was long, his lance was keen.\nHis shining helm afar was seen;\nthe countless stars of heaven's field\nwere mirrored in his silver shield.\n\nBut long ago he rode away,\nand where he dwelleth none can say;\nfor into darkness fell his star\nin Mordor where the shadows are.\n\u2015 From The Fall of Gil-galad, as translated by Bilbo Baggins[9][note 2]",

To the three Hobbits, Gildor and the Elves appeared to shimmer as they walked through the night. The starlight glimmered in their hair and eyes. They camped in a clearing in the Woody End near Woodhall and the Elves provided the Hobbits with bread and fruit and a fragrant drink.[2]\nGildor and the hobbits, by Alan Lee\nFrodo stayed up late talking to Gildor about the many dangers that the Hobbits might soon face. Frodo had greeted Gildor by saying, \"Elen s\u00edla l\u00famenn' omentielvo\" (A star shines upon the hour of our meeting) impressed with his knowledge of the ancient tongue and lore he commended Frodo and named him Elf-friend. Gildor perceived that the Enemy was seeking for Frodo, though he did not know why. He was reluctant to give Frodo any advice in Gandalf's absence.[2]\nGildor: \"That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well. But it is said: \"Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.\" The choice is yours: to go or wait.\"Frodo: \"And it is also said, 'Go not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes.'\"\n\u2014The Fellowship of the Ring, \" Three is Company\"\nGildor then advised Frodo to leave quickly, to take with him friends he could trust, and to flee from the Nazg\u00fbl. He also promised to send out word to Elves and others to be on the lookout for Frodo and help him on his journey.[2] Gildor was true to his word, for both Tom Bombadil and Aragorn heard of Frodo's peril from Gildor.[3] Word also reached Rivendell, and Glorfindel rode out to find Aragorn and the Hobbits as they were pursued by the Nazg\u00fbl from Weathertop.[4]\nGildor and the Elves continued on their way. Gildor had told Frodo they were tarrying in Middle-earth before heading to the Grey Havens to pass over the Sea to the Undying Lands. Where they wandered is not known, but on September 22, 3021, Gildor and Frodo met once again in the same spot in Woody End where they had met three years earlier. Along with Elrond, Galadriel and Gandalf, they journeyed to the Grey Havens. Gildor may have been among those that departed over the Sea into the West.[1]",

It is also stated in Unfinished Tales that Gimli was prevented from traveling with his father on the Quest of Erebor\u00a0because Thorin and Company thought him too young, though Gimli, being in his sixties, considered himself ripe for adventure and was disappointed to be left behind.[1]\nInvolvement with the Ring\nIn TA 3018, an emissary from Mordor approached the King under the Mountain, D\u00e1in II, with offers of friendship and requests for news of a Hobbit bearing a Ring, as Sauron had become aware that the name Baggins was known to the Dwarf king. Not trusting the messenger, D\u00e1in sent Gl\u00f3in and Gimli to Rivendell to seek the advice of Elrond, and to warn Bilbo that the Enemy was seeking him. As a result, they were summoned to the Council of Elrond, where Elrond believed they would find the answers to their questions and would be able to contribute. Whilst there, Gl\u00f3in told Elrond of the messenger and made reference to Balin, who had entered Moria and attempted to reclaim it. However, he had not sent any word to King D\u00e1in II for over twenty years, and Gl\u00f3in was concerned. The Council ultimately chose to send Frodo Baggins to Mordor to destroy the Ring and decided that a small fellowship should go with him. Gimli volunteered to accompany the Fellowship to Mordor to destroy the One Ring.[2]\nGimli portrayed by John Rhys-Davies in the films\nDonato Giancola's depiction of Gimli battling Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep\nHe volunteered to join the company at least in part because Legolas had volunteered and he doubted the Elf's intentions. Gimli journeyed with the Fellowship southward along the Misty Mountains. However, the Fellowship was stymied in their attempt to traverse the pass of Caradhras, and were compelled to travel under the mountain rather than go over it. While none in the Fellowship were particularly keen on passing through Moria, Gimli was at least eager to learn what may have happened to Balin. Unfortunately, whilst in Moria, Gimli discovered Balin's Tomb as well as evidence that all of the Dwarves who had attempted to retake Moria had been slain years prior; his uncle \u00d3in had been killed by the Watcher in the Water.\nAfter Gandalf fell with Durin's Bane from the Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm,[3][4] the Fellowship entered the Woods of Lothl\u00f3rien, thus making Gimli the first Dwarf to enter that realm since the Balrog was awakened in Moria. However, there was some tension regarding Gimli's being in the Wood, and his Elven escorts wished to blindfold him for the journey. Gimli staunchly refused until Aragorn decided that all in the Fellowship should be blindfolded to make the Elven demand more equitable. While in L\u00f3rien, he accompanied Legolas on many walks through the woods, and the two became fast friends. When the Fellowship departed, he asked for one strand of Galadriel's hair, intending to set it inside impregnable crystal and become an heirloom of his house. While she had refused the same request from F\u00ebanor, Galadriel generously gave him three, which would lead to his name in later years of \"Lockbearer\". When the Fellowship of the Ring fractured, Gimli accompanied Aragorn and Legolas in pursuit of Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, who had been captured by the forces of Isengard.\nGimli fighting at Parth Galen\nEventually, the three were reunited with Gandalf and became involved in the War of the Ring. Gimli played a critical role in the defeat of the army of Isengard at the Battle of the Hornburg, where he was separated from Aragorn and Legolas and driven into the caves which he would later become lord of. He fought his way out alongside \u00c9omer when the forces of Isengard were driven from Helm's Deep. His skill with an axe led to his winning, by one Orc, the friendly contest he and Legolas held over who could kill the most Orcs, despite starting with a disadvantage.\nGimli then accompanied Aragorn, Legolas and the Grey Company through the Paths of the Dead in an attempt to recruit the Army of the Dead. Capturing the Corsair ships and gathering many men of southern Gondor, the forces under Aragorn, including Gimli, sailed to Minas Tirith. After being victorious at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Gimli accompanied Aragorn and a mixed force from Gondor and Rohan to the Black Gate.\n\n\"To Gimli son of Gl\u00f3in, give his Lady's greeting. Lockbearer, wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee. But have a care to lay thine axe to the right tree!\"\n\u2014Galadriel's message to Gimli\nLife after the War\nAfter the War, Gimli led a number of Durin's Folk south to establish a new Dwarf settlement in the Glittering Caves, which were located behind Helm's Deep where Gimli was trapped during the battle, and he became the first Lord of the Glittering Caves. The Dwarves of the Glittering Caves, led by Gimli, would repair much of the physical damage that was incurred during the War of the Ring in both Gondor and Rohan. Most notably, they rebuilt Minas Tirith's Great Gate with a new one made of mithril and steel, as well as improving upon the existing layout of the entire city.\nGimli was 139 years old (born in 2879 of the Third Age) when the Fellowship of the Ring set out from Rivendell, making him 52 years older than Aragorn. The date of his death is not known, and according to the Red Book of Westmarch, he is said to have traveled with Legolas into the West, thus becoming the first Dwarf to visit the Undying Lands. Of this possibility, Tolkien wrote that it would be strange indeed, that any Dwarf should be willing to leave Middle-earth for any love, or that the Eldar should receive him, or that the Lords of the West should permit it, but that it is said that Gimli went not only because of his great friendship with Legolas but also out of desire to see again the beauty of Galadriel, and that she, being mighty among the Eldar, may have obtained this grace for him. Regardless of this, he was not seen again in Middle-earth.[5]",

After the battle he followed Turgon to Gondolin, where he was appointed as the lord of the house of the Golden Flower and one of the captains of the King. He was popular and well-loved by the Gondolindrim.\nWhen Aredhel wished to depart Gondolin to seek the Sons of F\u00ebanor, Turgon appointed Glorfindel, Ecthelion, and Egalmoth as her escorts. They were denied entrance to Doriath, and instead turned north where the escort lost Aredhel near Nan Dungortheb. They later returned to Gondolin without her.[5]\nAlong with King Turgon, Glorfindel fought in the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad, holding the King's flanks as they retreated towards the Pass of Sirion.[6][7]\nFall of Gondolin\nIn FA 510, the forces of Melkor attacked Gondolin, with the help of Maeglin's treachery. Glorfindel and the last of his followers held the Great Market from the Orcs, in pursuance of ambushing the enemies. However, they themselves were ambushed and fought until a fire-drake arrived. Glorfindel and his people cut their way out, but were pursed by the Orcs. The house of the Harp arrived to help after disobeying their deceitful lord, Salgant. The house of the Golden Flower regrouped at the Place of the Fountain and was one of the last houses to fight.[2]\nGlorfindel and a Balrog, falling from Gondolin's ledge, by Eric Velhagen\nEcthelion and Glorfindel, by Jenny Dolfen\nGlorfindel joined Tuor in defending the Square, until Egalmoth arrived and Ecthelion was slain during his fight with the first Lord of Balrogs, the High-Captain of Angband Gothmog. When King Turgon was also slain, the Gondolindrim escaped through Idril's secret way, with Glorfindel holding the rear manfully and lost more of his followers there.[2]\nAs they made their escape through Cirith Thoronath, a Balrog commanding an Orc-contingent came upon the refugees. Glorfindel leapt forward to face the demon, while his followers watched from afar. He fended himself from the Balrog's whip and claws, and successfully hewed its iron helm. At the last moment, he pierced the demon's belly and it fell backwards towards the cliff, but the Balrog grabbed Glorfindel by his hair such that he fell with it. Glorfindel's body was later borne up by Thorondor, King of the Eagles, who flew down into the abyss to rescue Glorfindel's broken body, returning it to his people who buried him high on the cliffs of the mountains that surrounded Gondolin. It was said that yellow flowers (possibly celandine) grew on his mound, despite its rocky location.[2] The fiery combat sparked the phrase \"Glorfindel against the Balrog\" among the Eldar, on occasions when a power of good was hopelessly outmatched by powers of evil.[8]\nGlorfindel, by Soni Alcorn-Hender\nSecond Age\nReturn to Middle-earth\nGlorfindel's spirit departed to the Halls of Mandos, where he passed a short time. Due to his noble actions that had saved many Elves in the Fall of Gondolin, he was re-embodied and dwelt in Valinor.\nMany years later, in SA 1600, Manw\u00eb sent him back to Middle-earth as an emissary of the Valar and granted him powers nearly as strong as those of the Maiar.[9]\nThird Age\nIt is possible that Glorfindel remained for a time in Lindon along with other noble Elves, such as Gil-galad, C\u00edrdan, and Elrond, a descendant of Tuor and Idril. However, by the mid-Third Age he dwelt in Rivendell.\n\nBattle of Fornost\nDo not pursue him! He will not return to this land. Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall.\u2014Glorfindel's prophecy about the Witch-king[10]\nGlorfindel returning to Middle-earth from the Blessed Lands, by Ralph Damiani\nIn the Battle of Fornost, Glorfindel turned the odds against the Witch-king of Angmar and his host. After the battle finished, and the Witch-king had fled, it was Glorfindel who predicted that no mortal man would ever destroy the Witch-king.[10] This prediction was fulfilled a thousand years later at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, when \u00c9owyn of Rohan and Meriadoc Brandybuck, a hobbit, slew the Witch-king.[11]\nWar of the Ring\nSuddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows, running swiftly. In the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed, as if it were studded with gems like living stars. The rider's cloak streamed behind him, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed.... it appeared that white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider, as if though through a thin veil.\u2014The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I: The Fellowship of the Ring, \"Flight to the Ford\"\nNearly a thousand years later in TA 3018, Glorfindel was sent by Lord Elrond to search for Frodo Baggins and his companions. He attacked some of the Nazg\u00fbl and drove them away from the Last Bridge, pursuing them for awhile. He then found and led the company for days stopping only briefly to let the Hobbits rest. When the Nazg\u00fbl approached again, Glorfindel put Frodo on his white horse Asfaloth, and bade the horse take Frodo to Rivendell. Asfaloth outran the black horses of the Nazg\u00fbl and managed to cross the Ford of Bruinen which led to Rivendell. A severely weakened Frodo, conscious but delirious due to the wound he bore from the Morgul-knife, turned back to defy the Riders who pleaded for him to come with them. The Nazg\u00fbl entered the shallow ford but were there un-horsed and swept away by a torrent of enchanted water which guarded the entrance to Imladris charged with the power of the Half-elven and indeed by Gandalf the Grey.[12] He later led the injured Frodo and the rest of the company safely to Rivendell.\nAt the Council of Elrond, Glorfindel sat in a position of honour alongside Elrond and Gandalf. He suggested that the One Ring should be either sent to Tom Bombadil or cast into the depths of the Sea, but Gandalf believed that the One would resurface on land after a hundred or thousand years. He was briefly considered to be a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, but was later ruled out: his power would be of no use in a mission of secrecy to Mordor.[13]\nAfter the War\nAfter the Ring's destruction, Glorfindel, along with Erestor and the sons of Elrond, witnessed the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen.[14] His ultimate fate is not known, but it is reasonable to assume that he eventually sailed to Valinor with the rest of his kin.\nGlorfindel in the Third Age, by C.K.

He recounted the history of the Lonely Mountain and the Kingdom of Dale since Bilbo had left, including Balin's decision to leave the Lonely Mountain and re-establish the ancient Dwarven kingdom in Moria.\u00a0At the Council of Elrond, his son Gimli warned of the messengers from Mordor who had been threatening King D\u00e1in II Ironfoot, seeking news of Bilbo, Frodo, and the One Ring.

Then Sauron revealed that Gorlim had seen but a spectre devised by him, for his wife was already dead, but that he would keep his word and reunite Gorlim with his wife: he had Gorlim put to death.\nAfter Sauron's Orc-warriors had slain all of Barahir's remaining men but for his son Beren, who was out hunting Orcs, Gorlim appeared as a spectre before Beren, and confessed what he had done, giving Beren a chance to reclaim the Ring of Barahir, heirloom of his house, and escape alive.[2][3]",

In particular, Grimbold managed to save Th\u00e9odred's body from Saruman's Uruk-hai after he was mortally wounded. Grimbold later assumed command of the Rohirrim of Westfold, as Erkenbrand was delayed, sharing it with Elfhelm.\nWhile Elfhelm wanted to abandon the Fords, Grimbold wanted to hold them, partially due to the tradition of Westfold. Grimbold was surrounded but his shield-wall held despite no aid from Erkenbrand and Elfhelm. Grimbold then orchestrated a daring break out. He mounted all the riders for whom he had horses and made a gap on the east side of the wall through which the riders passed. They formed into two groups and attacked the north and south sides simultaneously. In the ensuing confusion, the remaining Rohirrim retreated on foot as quickly as they could in the dark.\nAs depicted in The Lord of the Rings Online\nAs a reward for his valour, he was promoted to Third Marshal of the Mark (holding the function though not the title), which was left vacant when \u00c9omer was reinstated to lead the first \u00e9ored in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Grimbold fell in that battle slain by Orcs. Afterwards, the memory of his death as with others was lamented in the Mounds of Mundburg; in it he is described as \"doughty\".[2]",

He was ultimately captured when Morgoth's reserves were set forth from the fortress and the armies of Men and Elves were overrun. He was enslaved and put into one of the stone-gangs of Angband for seventeen years (FA 472 -489).\nGwindor later escaped Angband, but his hand was cut off in a fight with a guard. The injury devastated Gwindor and he fell into despair in the wilderness, and nearly died of the wound. He was rescued by Beleg and his will to live returned. He later helped Beleg free T\u00farin and, after Beleg's tragic and accidental death, Gwindor found himself trying to rouse T\u00farin as Beleg had roused him. He brought T\u00farin to Nargothrond, and in time would counsel against T\u00farin's policy of open warfare against Morgoth, but was ignored. He loved the Elf Finduilas, but found himself unfit to wed her, and an engagement between them was broken. He grew jealous of T\u00farin since she loved him more, and felt T\u00farin had gained respect from the council at his expense. He warned Finduilas that T\u00farin was cursed and would bring doom to the people he loved. Nevertheless, Gwindor pitied and loved him.\nHe was mortally wounded\u00a0in the Battle of Tumhalad, the last battle of Nargothrond. T\u00farin abandoned the battle and bore him to safety, but his wounds could not be healed. Gwindor died reproaching T\u00farin for his pride and pleading him to save Finduilas, who alone stood between T\u00farin and his doom.[2][3][4]",

        "biography": "Heraldic Device of the House of Hador\nHador was the son of Hathol and the great-great-grandson of Marach, (who first led the people of the Third House into Beleriand and was their first chieftain), and heir to the House of Marach. He entered the service of Fingolfin, the High King of the \u00d1oldor, at a young age. Hador was loved by the King, and he rose high in the esteem of many of the Eldar. Eventually, Hador would even become a part of Fingolfin's own council. Realizing the need for the Edain to live under their own lords and have lands of their own, Fingolfin granted as a fief to Hador the land of Dor-l\u00f3min (land of echoes) which thus made him the first Lord of Dor-l\u00f3min. Hador gathered most of the people of the Third House into that land, which lay in Hithlum. There, Hador's people became numerous; and he encouraged the use of the Sindarin tongue.\nHador continued to win renown among the Eldar as the Lord of Dor-l\u00f3min, as well as among Men. Two of Hador's children, Galdor and Gl\u00f3redhel, were wedded to two of the children of Halmir, Chieftain of the Haladin, respectively Hareth, his daughter, and Haldir, his son of the House of Haleth, when the two peoples met for a great feast. Fingolfin also gave to Hador a great helm made by Telchar of Nogrod. It was made in the likeness of the dragon Glaurung, and came to be known as the Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min; it could only be borne by one of great stature and strength. In the year 455 of the First Age, Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband in the Dagor Bragollach. Hador fought alongside Fingolfin with what few warriors of the Third House he could gather against the swift onset of Morgoth's forces. He was slain, however, defending the retreat of his lord. His younger son, Gundor, fell beside him before the fortress of Barad Eithel. It was said that their deaths were greatly mourned by the Eldar.\nThe Dragon Helm, by Alan Lee.\nHador was the forefather of many heroes. His grandsons were H\u00farin and Huor. His great-grandsons were T\u00farin and Tuor, and his great-great grandson was E\u00e4rendil the Mariner. Aragorn Elessar, as well as all the Kings of N\u00famenor, Gondor and Arnor were descended from Hador.[2] Perhaps the greatest testament to the legacy of Hador was that which was later written about his descendants:\n\"The Men of the Three Houses throve and multiplied, but greatest among them was the house of Hador Goldenhead, peer of Elven-lords. His people were of great strength and stature, ready in mind, bold and steadfast, quick to anger and to laughter, mighty among the Children of Il\u00favatar in the youth of Mankind.\"[citation

Hador ruled Gondor until his death in TA 2395 at the age of 150 years old after a rule of one-hundred and seventeen years.

Little do they know of our long labor for the safekeeping of their borders, and yet I grudge it not.\"\nIn response to a message sent to Rivendell by Galadriel, Halbarad led the Grey Company, comprised of 30 Rangers, south to the aid of their kinsman Aragorn. Aragorn rejoiced at their coming, and Th\u00e9oden remarked thus; \"It is well! If these kinsmen be in any way like yourself, my Lord Aragorn, thirty such knights will be a strength that cannot be counted by heads.\"\nWith them also rode Elladan and Elrohir, the sons of Elrond. They caught up with Aragorn near the Fords of Isen in Rohan in the early hours of March 6, TA 3019. Halbarad brought Aragorn a message from Arwen as well as a standard made by her, which Aragorn asked Halbarad to keep for him for a while.\nHalbarad accompanied Aragorn to a chamber high in the Hornburg where Aragorn looked into the palant\u00edr and revealed himself to Sauron. That morning Aragorn decided to take the Paths of the Dead, down the Dimholt Road, under the White Mountains and Halbarad and the Grey Company went with him, along with Legolas and Gimli. When they reached the entrance at daybreak on March 8, Halbarad said, \"This is an evil door, and my death lies beyond it. I will dare to pass it nonetheless...\"[1]\nAt midnight at the Stone of Erech, Aragorn summoned the Dead to fulfil their oaths and Halbarad unfurled Aragorn's standard, which appeared black with no device in the darkness. The Grey Company and the Army of the Dead passed through the lands of the south to Pelargir, where they captured the fleet of the Corsairs. Aragorn dismissed the Dead, and the Grey Company sailed up the Anduin.[2]\nWhen they arrived at the Pelennor Fields on March 15 in the midst of the battle, Aragorn's standard was once again unfurled but now it was seen to bear the emblems of the House of Elendil; the White Tree of Gondor surmounted by seven stars and a crown. Halbarad carried the standard onto the battlefield, where he was killed.[3]",

Haldir was able to speak to the Fellowship, for he knew the Common Tongue. He welcomed Legolas as a distant kinsman from the north (Mirkwood), and recognized Aragorn as a friend to Lady Galadriel. He was prepared to lead the Fellowship into L\u00f3rien, but hesitated upon learning that one of the party was a Dwarf. After consulting with his brothers, Haldir agreed that Gimli could enter if he went blindfolded. The fellowship then insisted that if one of them had to go blindfolded, they all would. The brothers reluctantly agreed, and then led them into the forest.[1]\nThey spent the night on a flet, or a platform in the trees. During the night, Haldir and his brothers heard Orcs passing and lured them away from the Fellowship. When he returned to the flet, Haldir saw a strange creature at the base of the tree, which Frodo guessed to be Gollum.\nIn the morning, Haldir fashioned a rope bridge for the Fellowship to use to cross the Silverlode. Haldir learned from Merry Brandybuck that the Grey Havens lay west of the Shire, and he spoke longingly of the sea, but sadly of the time when he and his kin would have to leave L\u00f3rien. When news came that the Fellowship's blindfolds could be removed, Haldir apologized to Gimli and welcomed him as the first Dwarf to enter L\u00f3rien since the time of Durin.\nAfter guiding the Fellowship to Caras Galadhon, Haldir returned to his duties guarding the northern borders, but he returned when the Fellowship was about to depart to guide them to the banks of the Silverlode, where boats awaited them.[1]\nNothing further is known of Haldir's activities. It is likely that he participated in the defense of Lothl\u00f3rien when the forces of Dol Guldur attacked it in March of 3019.\nHaldir was one of the few Elves of L\u00f3rien who could speak Westron. He had clearly heard of Aragorn, but there is no indication that they had met previously.",

        "biography": "At the time of her birth, the Haladin had settled in Thargelion, in East Beleriand. After her father and her twin brother Haldar were slain in an Orc raid, Haleth became leader of the House. She held her people together for seven days until Caranthir\u00a0and his army drove out the Orcs and ended their siege on the Haladin. Seeing, at last, what great courage dwelt in the hearts of some Men, Caranthir did Haleth great honor by offering her people land in the north under the protection of the Eldar. However, out of pride and a desire to remain independent, she declined the generous offer and instead gathered what remained of her people after the Orc siege and led them to Estolad.\nAgainst the desire of her people, Haleth led the Haladin even further west to the land between the Mountains of Terror and the Girdle of Melian. Suffering much hardship and loss, many regretted taking part in the journey. Eventually, Haleth led her people to the relative safety of the Forest of Brethil on the western border of Doriath where they settled for the duration of the First Age. The Haladin then became known as the House of Haleth. She remained chieftainess of the Haladin until she died and retained a picked bodyguard of women. When she died, her people raised a green mound for her in the heights of the forest - named\u00a0T\u00fbr Haretha, the Ladybarrow, or Haudh-en-Arwen in Sindarin. Having never married, the leadership of the Haladin passed on to her nephew Haldan, son of her brother Haldar.[1]",

        "biography": "Haleth was born sometime around TA 2716, during the last years of the reign of his great-grandfather King D\u00e9or, the seventh King of Rohan. He would be the eldest son of Prince Helm Hammerhand and his unnamed wife, and would later have a sister, whose name is unknown, as well as a younger brother named H\u00e1ma. His father Helm was the son of Gram, son and heir apparent to the reigning King D\u00e9or. When Haleth was a baby in TA 2718 his great-grandfather King D\u00e9or, now an old man at seventy-four, died after a nineteen-year reign spent fighting the Dunlendings and was succeeded by Haleth's grandfather Gram, who became the eighth king of Rohan.\nThe reign of Haleth's grandfather Gram saw the continuation of hostilities with the Dunlendings that had begun under the reign of King D\u00e9or. Eventually, Gram died in TA 2741, and Helm succeeded him as ninth king of Rohan.\nDuring the reign of Helm, the King came into conflict with a powerful Dunlending landowner called Freca, who obstinately asked Helm for his daughter's hand in marriage for his son. King Helm took exception to his request and killed Freca with his bare hands in TA 2754. This would lead to another great war when the slain Freca's son and heir Wulf took a large host of Dunlendings to invade Rohan in TA 2758. When the invaders reached Edoras later that year, Haleth was killed defending the doors of the Golden Hall. Haleth's younger brother H\u00e1ma and his father Helm himself would also die later on in this conflict in TA 2759.\nWith the deaths of King Helm and his sons, the main branch of the House of Eorl would become extinct. Therefore, the crown was claimed by the 33 year old Fr\u00e9al\u00e1f Hildeson, a maternal grandson of King Gram via his daughter Princess Hild (sister of the late King Helm) who would avenge his uncle and cousins deaths by killing Wulf in single combat. Fr\u00e9al\u00e1f would begin a cadet branch that formed the second line of the Kings of Rohan that would last until the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age.[1]",

The two became very close friends and frequently met with each other in the pastures. There he sang songs to her for he was quite skilled in such things and she was pleased, but he altered his songs to lament the lovers of old in an attempt to express his love for her. Afterwards, he did declare his love for her but she did not return it and drew back. It was after this that he revealed what his true name was and his lineage. Angry at this deception, she rejected him, at least at first but eventually they did agree to wed despite the fact that she did not desire to be married.\nThey married in SA 1000. Their marriage seemed to be for political reasons as Ancalim\u00eb needed to produce an heir to continue the royal bloodline and to prevent her cousin Soronto, who also had a claim to the throne of N\u00famenor from becoming king. Hallacar's life with the Queen was not a happy one but they did have a son An\u00e1rion, the future Tar-An\u00e1rion. Afterwards the two became estranged and begun living apart from each other.[1]",

        "biography": "Hardang was a descendant of Halmir of the House of Haleth. His father was Hundad, and his grandfather was Hundar. After the death of the Halbar of Brethil, Handir, Hardang tried to supersede his cousin, Brandir, in acquiring the leadership of the Men of Brethil. Many Haladin believed Brandir to be unfit to rule them, and therefore supported Hardang.\nMany people wanted Brandir's cousin Manthor to assume the role of Halbar instead. Unfortunately for him and his supporters, he was related to Brandir by a daughter, which meant that his kinship with Brandir was worth less in the eyes of the people. Hardang then won the vote, and became the Halbar of the Men of Brethil in FA 499. Upon becoming Halbar, Hardang chose Manthor to be the Captain of the Guards at the Crossings of Taeglin.\nWithin two years of ruling Brethil, whispers of the return of H\u00farin began echoing throughout Brethil. Hardang harbored resentment for the House of Hador, of which H\u00farin was a member, as it was not his own, and many of the houses of the time had harsh rivalries. Therefore, upon H\u00farin's arrival, Hardang launched an attack against him. H\u00farin wounded Hardang in the battle, and Manthor later defended H\u00farin and restored his honor, which made Hardang's approval with the people suffer.\nH\u00farin survived the conflict, and Hardang lost a great deal more public approval for the attempt on his life. A group of the citizens then banded together and burned the Hall of the Haladin, from where all the Chieftains had ruled, with the intent of killing Hardang. He tried to flee from the burning structure, but was hit in the back by a spear while running away, and perished.[2]",

        "biography": "Helm was born in TA 2691 to the royal House of Eorl that had ruled Rohan since TA 2510, during the reign of his great-grandfather, King Goldwine, sixth King of Rohan. Helm was the son of Prince Gram, the grandson of King Goldwine as son of Crown Prince D\u00e9or. When Helm was a young boy in TA 2699, the elderly King Goldwine died at the age of 80 after a long, peaceful reign, and the Crown Prince, aged 55, succeeded him as seventh King of Rohan. With King D\u00e9or's ascension, Helm's father Gram become the new Crown Prince, while Helm himself became second in line to the throne as grandson of the reigning monarch.\nUnlike the reign of Helm's great-grandfather, King Goldwine, that Helm had spent his early childhood under, the reign of D\u00e9or was marked by conflict with the Dunlendings, a race of wild men inhabiting the lands bordering Rohan. Eleven years into King D\u00e9or's reign in TA 2710, by which time his grandson Prince Helm had grown to manhood, the Dunlendings would successfully capture the Gondorian fortress of Isengard, which they would use in succeeding years as a base. King D\u00e9or would die in TA 2718 at the old age of 74 after 19 years on the throne, and his 50-year-old son Crown Prince Gram, Helm's father, would succeed him as the Eighth King of Rohan. By now 27 years old, Helm would become the Crown Prince of Rohan and first in line to the throne.\nLike the reign of Helm's grandfather King D\u00e9or, the reign of Helm's father King Gram saw a continuation of hostilities with the Dunlendings who would operate from the captured palace of Isengard to raid Rohan. In fact, the entirety of King Gram's 23-year reign was marked by open warfare with the Dunlendings, which Crown Prince Helm likely took part in. King Gram would die in TA 2741, and Crown Prince Helm, now aged 50, would finally succeed him as the ninth King of Rohan.\nDuring his reign, King Helm came into conflict with an arrogant and powerful landowner named Freca.[1] Freca was a Dunlending with Rohirric blood; he claimed to be a descendant of King Fr\u00e9awine of Rohan. Freca viewed King Helm with both contempt and scorn, while Helm mistrusted Freca and was wary of him.\nIn TA 2754, Freca attempted to intimidate and coerce King Helm into giving his approval and consent to an arranged marriage between Freca's son Wulf and Helm's daughter. Freca marched to a meeting of the King's council in Edoras with numerous retainers, planning to threaten the King into complying with his demands. In the resulting quarrel, Helm Hammerhand smote Freca with a single blow from his fist. The blow was so great, Freca died soon after. Enraged, the men of Freca left Edoras, and King Helm declared Wulf and his kin enemies of the King.[1]\nHelm's fatal blow to Freca - The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim\nFour years later in TA 2758, a combined force of Dunlendings under the leadership of Wulf, Corsairs of Umbar, and Easterlings overran Rohan. Helm was defeated in battle at the Fords of Isen, and withdrew into the S\u00fathburg at Helm's Deep (which was later renamed in his honor). There, he endured a long siege.[1]\nWhile King Helm and his younger son Prince H\u00e1ma were besieged in the Hornburg, a force of Dunlendings under the leadership of Wulf also besieged Edoras. Prince Haleth, King Helm's elder son, led the defence of Edoras. He was the last to fall defending the doors of the Golden Hall.[1]\nShortly after Yule 2758, Prince H\u00e1ma accompanied by a small force went out to search for food, but he and his men were lost in a blizzard and never seen again. The S\u00fathburg held a large war-horn, and whenever it was blown, Helm would break through the Dunlending ranks, slaying many of their men. Helm was described as clad in white and stalking his prey, resembling a Snow-troll. Helm's enemies came to fear him greatly during this time, and it was believed that he became so fierce and terrible, that he slew many of them with his bare hands. It was also believed that when he grew hungry and had no food he ate men, grief, and hunger having made Helm more ferocious.\nAfter one sortie, Helm went to fight and did not return; his body was discovered the next morning frozen in the snow still standing, dead, his eyes open, ready to fight. This led to a belief among the Rohirrim and Dunlendings that even in death the wraith of Helm Hammerhand still wandered through Rohan, and defended the Hornburg. Helm died in TA 2759 at the age of 68. His nephew Fr\u00e9al\u00e1f Hildeson, who defeated the Dunlendings, succeeded Helm.\nHelm was called Hammerhand because of his great strength and prowess with his fists: he was known to fight barehanded. This is sometimes attributed to a superstition that if \"he used no weapon no weapon would upon bite him\".[1][2]",

        "biography": "Hyarmendacil was born Ciryaher to King Ciryandil, who was slain defending Umbar, under siege by the Haradrim and Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans. As Gondor's enemies to the south had yet to be subdued or pacified, he began his reign by reorganizing Gondor's armies. He launched a great assault by land and sea on the Haradrim in TA 1050 and won a great victory, lifting the siege of Umbar and breaking the power of the Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans for good. The Haradrim were forced to recognize him as their overlord and paid tribute to Gondor, and their sons where forced to live as hostages in the court of the king. After this victory, he called himself Hyarmendacil, meaning South-victor.\nAfter the defeat of Harad, Gondor became very rich and during his reign the realm reached its greatest extent and power. The passes of Mordor were well guarded by fortresses, so evil found no chance to spawn during Hyarmendacil's reign. No one dared to contest his power and Gondor was at peace for the rest of his long reign of 134 years. He died in TA 1149 at the age of two-hundred and fifty and was the fourth and last of the Ship-kings. He was succeeded by Atanatar II, his son, who did little to maintain the power his father had built.[2]",

        "biography": "Life in Dor-l\u00f3min[]\nH\u00farin was a grandson of Hador, of the House of Marach, or House of Hador. H\u00farin was the elder son of Galdor and Hareth of the Haladin, and he had a younger brother Huor. He was known to be of unimpressive stature, so much so that he could not wear the Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min because it was too large on him to fit properly. Despite this, his prowess in combat surpassed that of all his peers.\nIn the year FA 458, Huor and H\u00farin dwelt with their mother's kin in the forest of Brethil, when they joined a war party against Orcs. The brothers ended up in the Vale of Sirion, and were cut off from their company. Chased by Orcs, the Vala Ulmo caused a mist to arise from the rivers, and the brothers escaped into Dimbar, where two Great Eagles picked them up and brought them to Gondolin. King Turgon of Gondolin welcomed the brothers, remembering Ulmo's prophecy that the House of Hador would aid Gondolin in their time of greatest need. Turgon wished them to remain as he grew to love them, but the brothers wished to return to their kin. The brothers swore an oath to keep Gondolin secret, and Eagles brought them back to Dor-l\u00f3min.\nIn FA 462 Morgoth assailed Hithlum and H\u00farin's father Galdor the Tall fell defending the Ered Wethrin. H\u00farin chased the Orcs away with heavy losses over the plains of Anfauglith. Afterwards, H\u00farin was the Lord of Dor-l\u00f3min, ruling over the Hadorian fief of Dor-l\u00f3min in Hithlum.\nTwo years later, he wedded Morwen Elf-Sheen of the House of B\u00ebor, and later in the year their son T\u00farin was born. A daughter Urwen followed, but she died aged three years old in a plague sent from Angband.\nNirnaeth Arnoediad[]\nIn FA 473, in the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad, H\u00farin fought alongside Huor and the Sons of Hador. In the midst of battle, he met again with Turgon, and their meeting was sweet. When the battle was lost, H\u00farin and Huor gathered all the remaining men of the House of Hador and they took a stand fighting off the Orcs, allowing Turgon to escape. Step by step, the army of Morgoth pushed them back into the Fen of Serech. They stepped back until the river Rivil was in front of them, there they did not take one-step back. They kept on fighting until dusk when Huor was slain. In the end, H\u00farin stood there alone, there he threw his sword and shield on the ground and he took a grand battle-axe of an Orc captain. He waded alone into Gothmog's bodyguard of Trolls, and with every one he slew he yelled with all his voice: \"Aure entuluva!\" (\"Day will come again!\") This battle cry was heard seventy times.\nH\u00farin enchained on Thangorodrim, by Kip Rasmussen\nH\u00farin fought with the battle axe until the axe itself withered away from the caustic blood of the trolls he had been slaying. He was grappled by the Orcs and taken hostage, even though he hewed their limbs off as they grabbed him. H\u00farin was brought captive to Morgoth, and despite horrific torture at the hands of the second Balrog lord Lungorthin (who smote Hurin across the mouth with a whistling fiery whip), he refused to reveal the location of Gondolin. Due to his defiance, Morgoth cursed him and his family to misery and hopelessness.\nH\u00farin was bound by Morgoth's power in a seat high on the peaks of Thangorodrim There, Morgoth cursed him with the ability to see from afar all the evils would befall his son, T\u00farin.[5] He never saw his second daughter Ni\u00ebnor, however, who was born while he was a captive.\nRelease from captivity and death[]\nHurin's last stand, by Jenny Dolfen\nIn the year FA 500, after the death of his children, Morgoth released H\u00farin, feigning pity to an utterly defeated foe.[6] In reality however, Morgoth hoped that the bitterness and hate that had been wrought in H\u00farin throughout his years of watching his family suffer would cause strife and misfortune to those whom H\u00farin encountered. He was brought to his old homelands in Hithlum, but the Easterlings now living there, under Lorgan, did not recognize him at first, and feared him, believing him to be high in the favor of Morgoth. The House of Hador had been destroyed or enslaved. Seven outlaws joined H\u00farin, and together they went to the vale of Sirion, where he knew Gondolin to be. In time H\u00farin abandoned the outlaws and sought for the entrance, but Gondolin was closed, and the King Turgon at first did not wish to allow him in. H\u00farin cried out against Turgon, thus inadvertently revealing the general location of Gondolin to Morgoth's spies, and then left. Only after he had left did Turgon have a change of heart, and sent Eagles to fetch him, but they came too late and did not find him.\nThe Death of Morwen, by Alan Lee\nH\u00farin continued to the forest of Brethil where his son and daughter had died, and met his wife Morwen there at their grave, minutes before she too passed away. In anger and despair, he sought out the Haladin, blaming them for the death of his wife and children, and after being put on trial caused a revolt in which Hardang, of the house of Haldad, was slain.[7] H\u00farin met up again with the outlaws, and together with a few of the Haladin, they went to Nargothrond, where H\u00farin killed the Petty-dwarf M\u00eem who had claimed the treasure of Glaurung, earning a curse on the gold. H\u00farin and his outlaws brought the treasure, including the Nauglam\u00edr, to Doriath, insulting Thingol by giving it as a fee for his 'good care' of H\u00farin's kin. The outlaws did not accept this, and a bitter battle was fought at Menegroth, leading to the death of all of them, and further cursing the gold. H\u00farin thus brought a curse on Doriath as well, eventually leading to its downfall.\nMelian's kind words managed to break through to H\u00farin's clouded mind, and H\u00farin finally saw that all his deeds had only aided Morgoth. A broken man, he finally cast himself in the sea and ended his life.",

Married to an unknown wife, he had three sons, Elphir, Erchirion and Amrothos and a daughter, Loth\u00edriel. Legolas said of him that:\n\"Here indeed was one who had elven-blood in his veins...If Gondor has such men still in these days of fading, great must have been its glory in the days of its rising\".\u2014The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King, The Last Debate\nWar of the Ring[]\nOn March 9, TA 3019, Prince Imrahil led a company of Swan Knights and 700 men at arms to Minas Tirith to help defend the city. Prince Imrahil led the sortie that rode to the aid of Faramir and the rear-guard who were retreating from Osgiliath when the forces of Sauron overran the Pelennor Fields on March 13. Gandalf rode with them, and the Winged Nazg\u00fbl fled before the Gandalf's light. The Knights of Dol Amroth rescued Faramir from the Southrons but he was poisoned, and Imrahil carried his nephew back to Minas Tirith on his horse. Gandalf then took command of the besieged city, and Prince Imrahil assisted him because Denethor in his madness retreated to the White Tower with his dying son, paying no further attention to the city's defense.\nDuring the Siege of Gondor, Imrahil and Gandalf made circuits of the Othram, bolstering the defenders before taking command of the defence of the Great Gate. On March 15th, with the arrival of Rohan, the defenders proceeded to sortie from the city to link up with them, with Imrahil leading the attack in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\nWhile paying respect to the procession bearing the body of King Th\u00e9oden of Rohan, Imrahil noticed that the Rohirrim also bore the body of \u00c9owyn. He perceived that she was still alive, and hurriedly had her sent to the Houses of Healing.\n\u00c9omer and his Riders were outnumbered, but Imrahil then rode into battle and came to their aid. Shortly after, Aragorn arrived in the Corsair fleet of the Umbar, and the tide of the battle was turned. After the Pelennor Fields had been cleared, Aragorn, \u00c9omer and Imrahil rode to the Gate of Minas Tirith.\nImrahil recognized that Aragorn was the rightful King of Gondor, but he agreed that it was wise for Aragorn to wait to enter the city because Imrahil knew his brother-in-law Denethor was strong-willed and proud. When Imrahil learned that Denethor was dead and Faramir was dying, he suggested that Aragorn be summoned, remembering that the kings of old were great healers. Aragorn came at Gandalf's request to heal the wounded Faramir, \u00c9owyn, and Merry, but he declared that Prince Imrahil should rule the city until Faramir awoke from his fevered slumber.\nIn the debate of the Captains of the West, Gandalf proposed that they march to the Black Gate to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo the Ring-bearer. Imrahil said that he would follow his liege Aragorn, but since Minas Tirith was under his command the Prince advised that some should remain to defend the City. In the end it was decided that an army of 7,000 would ride forth. Imrahil laughed and said:\n\"Surely this is the greatest jest in all the history of Gondor: that we should ride with seven thousands, scarce as many as the vanguard of its army in the days of its power, to assail the mountains and the impenetrable gate of the Black Land! So might a child threaten a mail-clad knight with a bow of string and green willow!\"\u2014The Return of the King: \"The Last Debate\")\nThe Army of the West left Minas Tirith on March 18. Bypassing Minas Morgul and marching north, the heralds announced the coming of King Elessar to Mordor at Imrahil's suggestion. When Sauron's forces emerged from the Black Gate on March 25, Imrahil stood in the front line. They fought the Battle of the Black Gate until the One Ring was destroyed.\nPrince Imrahil was present at the celebrations of the Field of Cormallen, and the coronation of Aragorn as King Elessar, and rode with the funeral procession of King Th\u00e9oden to Rohan, remaining in Edoras after the King's burial on August 10. Imrahil and \u00c9omer became great friends, and in TA 3021 \u00c9omer wed Imrahil's daughter Loth\u00edriel.[1]\nAfter the War of the Ring, Prince Imrahil and his nephew, Prince Faramir, were King Elessar's chief commanders. Imrahil was also part of the Council of Gondor, and remained an advisor to the King.\nPrince Imrahil died in the year 34 of the Fourth Age, and was succeed by his eldest son Elphir, who continued the line of Princes.[2]",

He retreated with those of his men who survived back to the city, reporting that the northern road had fallen into the hands of the enemy.

        "biography": "Life in N\u00famenor[]\nIsildur was born in N\u00famenor in the year SA 3209 of the Second Age.[1] His younger brother An\u00e1rion was born in SA 3219. They lived at the haven of R\u00f3menna on the east coast of the island of N\u00famenor. Their father was Elendil and their grandfather was Amandil, the Lord of And\u00fani\u00eb. The Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb were descended from the Kings of N\u00famenor through Silmari\u00ebn, the daughter and eldest child of the fourth King of N\u00famenor, Tar-Elendil.[2]\nAn\u00e1rion and Isildur (right) in their youth, by Billy Mosig\nElros, the Half-elven and the first King of N\u00famenor, had chosen the life of Men, while his brother Elrond chose the life of Elves. Over time, the Kings of N\u00famenor grew to resent their ancestor's choice, and desired eternal life for themselves. They became estranged from the Elves and the Valar, and neglected the worship of Eru, who had created them. A small group of N\u00famen\u00f3reans remained friendly with the Elves and faithful to Eru and the Valar. They were called the Faithful. Among these men were the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb.\nIn SA 3262, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, King of N\u00famenor, took Sauron captive and brought him to N\u00famenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken in order to corrupt the N\u00famen\u00f3reans, to orchestrate their downfall. Over time, he succeeded in gaining influence over the N\u00famen\u00f3rean authorities.\nIsildur learned that Sauron wanted King Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n to cut down Nimloth, the White Tree that had come from the Undying Lands. Isildur disguised himself and went secretly to the King's Court and took a fruit from Nimloth. The guards discovered and attacked him and, although receiving grave injuries, he managed to escape with the fruit. For this deed, Isildur received much praise. He stood near death for many months, but when the fruit of the White Tree began to sprout, he awoke and was recovered from his injuries.[2]\nAs Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave N\u00famenor. They filled nine ships with their families and many of their prized possessions, including the palant\u00edri. Isildur had three ships of his own, and he brought aboard the seedling of the White Tree, the Stone of Erech, as well as his wife and his son Elendur, who had been born in SA 3299.[1]\nIsildur's grandfather Amandil hoped to plead with the Valar to spare the Faithful. He sailed westward toward the Undying Lands, but what became of him is not known and he was never seen again.\nLife in Middle-earth[]\nThe nine ships of the Faithful were spared from the tumult of N\u00famenor's downfall, and a great wind from the west sent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north with four ships, while Isildur and An\u00e1rion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the south with three and two ships respectively. Elendil and his sons established the North-kingdom of Arnor and the South-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the High King of both realms, but he ruled from Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor to his sons.[3]\nIsildur lived in Minas Ithil to the east of the Anduin, while An\u00e1rion made his home in Minas Anor to the west of the Anduin. They ruled from their joint capital of Osgiliath, built on both banks of the river. Isildur built Minas Ithil in a valley of the Mountains of Shadow on the border of Mordor, planting the White Tree of Gondor before his house there. Minas Ithil was a beautiful city, but it was also a stronghold to defend against the evil that might still dwell in Mordor. It was not known at first that Sauron had survived the Downfall and had begun to rebuild his strength.\nIsildur had one of the palant\u00edr called the Ithil-stone, which he used to communicate with his brother and father. Isildur and his wife had two more sons while living in Gondor - Aratan born in SA 3339 and Ciryon born in SA 3379.\nIn the early days of Gondor, Isildur went to the Hill of Erech at the entrance to Imlad Morthond in the White Mountains. On the hilltop he placed the Stone of Erech, a great black sphere that he had brought from N\u00famenor. Isildur met with the King of the Mountain Men, who swore allegiance to Isildur upon the Stone, but later when Isildur called upon the Men of the Mountains to join the fight against Sauron, they refused. Isildur cursed them and said that they would never rest until they fulfilled their oath, and they haunted the Paths of the Dead.[4]\nSauron attacked and captured Minas Ithil in SA 3429. Isildur escaped with his wife and sons and a seedling of the White Tree. Isildur and his family boarded a ship at the Mouths of the Anduin and sailed around the coast of Middle-earth, seeking Elendil in Arnor. Elendil consulted with Gil-galad, the last High King of the \u00d1oldor in Middle-earth who lived in Lindon west of Arnor. Gil-galad and Elendil formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men to oppose Sauron in SA 3430. That same year, Isildur's youngest son Valandil was born at the home of Elrond in Rivendell.\nThe Last Alliance[]\nThe army of the Last Alliance gathered at Rivendell in SA 3431[5] and then marched to war. Isildur and his three oldest sons Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon went with the army, while Isildur's wife and their young son Valandil remained in Rivendell.\nThe War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434. Sauron's forces were defeated in the Battle of Dagorlad on the plain outside Mordor, and the army of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and laid siege to Barad-d\u00fbr. The siege lasted seven years and many Men and Elves were killed, including Isildur's brother An\u00e1rion, who died in SA 3440.[6]\nIsildur taking the One Ring, after his father and Gil-galad are slain - by Ralph Damiani\nAt last, in SA 3441, Sauron himself came down from his tower. He fought with Gil-galad and Elendil on the slopes of Mount Doom. Sauron's body was cast down, but Gil-galad and Elendil died in the struggle. Elendil's sword Narsil broke beneath him.\nIsildur took up the hilt of the sword and used the broken blade to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Sauron's spirit fled from his body, but as long as the Ring that held much of his power survived so would his spirit. Enamored by the Ring's apparent beauty, Isildur took it for himself. Elrond and C\u00edrdan were the only two individuals who marked Isildur's actions, as they alone had been with Gil-galad during the contest with Sauron, and Isildur alone had stood by Elendil.[6] Not long after, with the heat-induced markings on the Ring still visible, Isildur wrote a short account of the Ring and its apparent properties, noting that it had burned his hand so badly that he believed he would be in permanent pain. He noted that the Ring, as it cooled, seemed to shrink, and that the writing upon its outer band seemed to be fading. He theorized that the heat from Sauron's hand might have caused the writing to remain visible, and that heating it again might produce the same effect. However, he was already so enthralled by the Ring that he refused, even in writing, to take any action which might cause harm to it.\n\nRule and death[]\nIsildur assumed kingship of both Gondor and Arnor, but intended to return to the North and leave An\u00e1rion's son Meneldil to rule in the south, after mentoring him in the duties of a King. On the summit of Amon Anwar in the Firien wood, Isildur entombed the body of his father Elendil. Before leaving Minas Anor, Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree recovered from Minas Ithil in memory of his brother and established the Tradition of Isildur.\nDuring the few years in which Isildur had possession of the One Ring, he indicated that he had attempted to bend its tremendous power to his own will. However, he had failed in this endeavor, and the Ring's effects on his psyche had continued to grow until he could hardly bear it any longer. His eldest son and confidante, Elendur, suggested to his father that he should give the Ring into Elrond's keeping, and Isildur agreed.[7] On September 5, TA 2 of the Third Age, Isildur set out from Minas Anor with his three elder sons and a company of knights. They marched up the Vales of Anduin on the eastern side of the river, heading for the High Pass over the Misty Mountains.\nThirty days later, on October 4, Isildur's company was attacked by Orcs near the Gladden Fields. The Orcs were unaware that Isildur had the One Ring, but instead were unwittingly drawn by its power. Isildur's men were outnumbered ten to one, and though they initially managed to repel the attack by forming a shield-wall, the Orcs renewed their assault after nightfall and the men were overwhelmed.[8]\nIsildur putting on the Ring to escape\nBefore the battle had begun, Isildur had sent away his esquire Ohtar, bearing the shards of his father's sword Narsil. Isildur kept the One Ring, but it was useless in defending his men against the Orcs.\nIsildur's son Aratan was mortally wounded, and his son Ciryon was killed. His eldest son Elendur begged him to flee to in order to prevent the Orcs from capturing the Ring. Isildur agreed and parted with great sorrow from Elendur, who was slain leading the remaining D\u00fanedain.\nIsildur put on the Ring despite its pain and made for the River Anduin. He removed his armor and waded into the river intending to try to cross it. The current was strong and despite his great strength, it pulled him toward the marshes of the Gladden Fields. Then the Ring betrayed Isildur by slipping off his finger, and it then became lost in the waters. He rose out of the water but was spotted by Orcs who killed him with arrows.[7]\nLegacy[]\nThe One Ring remained at the bottom of the Anduin river in the Gladden Fields until D\u00e9agol found it in TA 2463.[5] Isildur's body also lay in the waters, undiscovered by his kin, but his weapons and armour were later recovered near the place of battle.[7] As he had been wearing the Elendilmir, this was lost with him. Since the One Ring indirectly caused Isildur's death by slipping from his finger and revealing him to the Orcs, it became known in Gondor's lore as Isildur's Bane.\nIsildur's youngest son Valandil became the High King of Arnor when he came of age in the year TA 10,[5] but he did not claim the Kingship of Gondor, and the two Kingdoms became separated. Gondor continued to be ruled by the heirs of An\u00e1rion, while Arnor was ruled by the heirs of Isildur. It was not until the end of the Third Age that the Kingdoms were reunited by Aragorn II, Isildur's heir. During his reign, evidence for the full story of his death was finally uncovered, as the Elendilmir and the necklace holding the One Ring were found in a secret chamber in Orthanc.[7] Saruman had likely found Isildur's remains and had them burnt.",

Her hair was yellow like the lilies that grew in the grass fields of Dor-l\u00f3min. She often took to \"going upon grass or under tree\", singing old songs from long ago that were made when the Edain first learned \"the tongue of the Elves\". It was because of this that H\u00farin once said to Morwen that Urwen was as \"fair as an Elf-child\u2026but briefer\".[5]\nDuring her short life, T\u00farin gave \"all the warmth of his heart\" to Urwen, though he rarely played with her, preferring instead \"to guard her unseen and\" watching her sing.[5]\nBefore the end of the Year of Lamentation, an sickness known as \"the Evil Breath came to Dor-l\u00f3min\" from Angband and both Urwen and T\u00farin fell ill. Sometime while T\u00farin still \"lay long in a fever and dark dream\", the Evil Breath took Urwen's life. Before T\u00farin recovered, Morwen blamed her death on the Enemy and forbade the household from speaking Urwen's nickname.[5]\nAfter T\u00farin was healed and \"asked for Lalaith\", his nurse relayed Morwen's command to him. When T\u00farin went and asked Morwen why he could not speak his sister's nickname, she told him that \"Urwen is dead, and laughter is stilled in this house\". H\u00farin tried to \"make a song of lamentation\", but his harp broke instead, causing him to curse \"the Marrer of Middle-earth\". Though T\u00farin abided by Morwen's command, he wept for Urwen bitterly alone at night. He later revealed to Sador that he had imagined that Urwen would grow up to look like one of the Eldar.[5]\nT\u00farin never got over her death and always looked for her likeness in women ever after.[7] During his time in Nargothrond, T\u00farin spoke of Urwen to Finduilas, confessing to her that she reminded him of how he imagined his sister would look grown up.[8]\nUpon finding N\u00edniel in the Forest of Brethil,[9] T\u00farin mistook her as being similar to both Urwen and Morwen \"in her looks and ways\",[1][10] and thus tragically causing him to wed her a few years later.[9]",

His exact date of birth and mother's name are unknown.\nWar of the Ring\nLegolas and Gimli at Helm's Deep, by John Howe\nLegolas came to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, the great meeting held by the Elf lord Elrond, as a messenger from his father to discuss the escape of Gollum. When the council was choosing the \"Nine Walkers\" to pit against the \"Nine Riders,\" Legolas volunteered to represent the Elves, and to become one of the members of the Fellowship that would set out to destroy the One Ring.[2]\nLegolas in combat with the Orcs during the Battle of the Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm\nDuring their journey, Legolas would stay at the rear due to his keen eyes. On Caradhras, Legolas was able to run nimbly over the snow, leaving behind little imprint, whereas his companions struggled to plough through it.[3] When Gandalf gave his counsel, Legolas voted against passing through Moria. In the morning, the Fellowship was waylaid by Wargs and Legolas fought in their defence. After the battle, he picked up his arrows, save one which was damaged.[4]\nGimli quarreled with him in Moria (which was not unexpected considering the ancient quarrel between Elves and Dwarves) - Legolas' father Thranduil had once imprisoned Gimli's father, Gl\u00f3in.[5]\nHe and Gimli became friends, however, when Gimli greeted the Elf, Lady Galadriel, with gentle words. Before the Fellowship departed from Lothl\u00f3rien, Legolas was given a new Galadhrim longbow.[6] While the Fellowship was travelling over the river Anduin, he used his new bow to shoot an overhead Nazg\u00fbl on a fellbeast with one masterful shot in the dark.[7]\nAfter the breaking of the Fellowship, Legolas and Aragorn sang a song of lament for the fall of Boromir.[8] He then led the way as he, Aragorn and Gimli raced through Rohan after the Uruk-hai who had taken Merry and Pippin. During that week, he was given a grey horse named Arod, on which he and Gimli would often ride together, from \u00c9omer and his \u00e9ored.[9]\nIn Fangorn Forest, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli were reunited with Gandalf, now called Gandalf the White. Upon their meeting, Gandalf delivered the messages of Galadriel to them:\nLegolas Greenleaf, long under tree, In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea! If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore, Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.\n\u2014Galadriel's message to Legolas[1]\nIn the Battle of the Hornburg, Legolas and Gimli engaged in an Orc-slaying contest[10]  that Gimli won (the score being 42 to 43, respectively), though Legolas was not jealous, stating, \"You have passed my score by one but I do not grudge you the game, so glad am I to see you on your legs.\"[11]\nIn Rohan, he and Gimli followed Aragorn, Elladan and Elrohir to the Paths of the Dead. His horse, Arod, refused to enter the paths, but Legolas calmed him. Their company rode on, with Elladan as the last, but Legolas looked back and saw the Dead following the Grey Company.\nThe Dead are following. I see shapes of Men and of horses, and pale banners like shreds of cloud, and spears like winter-thickets on a misty night. The Dead are following.\n\u2014Legolas in the Paths of the Dead[12]\n\"A Shot in the Dark\", by Ralph Damiani\nLegolas fought in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields with Gimli and the sons of Elrond.[13] After the battle, he and Gimli entered Minas Tirith; Legolas sang an elven-song as he walked, and suggested that the city needed more gardens. They met Prince Imrahil and went to the Houses of Healing, at which he remembered the cries of the gulls at Pelargir and sang a song about his newly kindled sea-longing.[14]\nSilver flow the streams from Celos to Erui\nIn the green fields of Lebennin!\nTall grows the grass there. In the wind from the Sea\nThe white lilies sway,\nAnd the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin\nIn the green fields of Lebennin,\nIn the wind from the Sea!\n- Legolas in The Return of the King, Book Five, Chapter IX: \"The Last Debate\"\nThe ship bearing Legolas and Gimli away from the Grey Havens, by Darrell Sweet\nAfter the war\nLegolas and Gimli coming to Valinor, by Ted Nasmith\nAfter the destruction of the One Ring and of Sauron, Legolas stayed for the coronation of Aragorn and his marriage to Arwen. Later, he and Gimli travelled together to Helm's Deep, visiting the Glittering Caves, and then traveled through Fangorn Forest as the two had previously sworn to each other they would. The Caves had seemingly left such an impression upon Legolas that he was speechless upon leaving them. Eventually, Legolas came to Ithilien with some of his people, with his father's leave, to live out his remaining time in Middle-earth helping to restore the woodlands that had been war-torn. After Aragorn's death, Legolas made a ship in Ithilien and left Middle-earth to go over the sea. His strong friendship with Gimli prompted Legolas to invite him to accompany him to the Undying Lands; making Gimli the only Dwarf to do so. He was never seen again in Middle-earth.[15][16]\nLegolas, imagined by Soni Alcorn-Hender",

Lorgan claimed the lordship of the northern land of Dor-l\u00f3min in Hithlum, which had been ruled by H\u00farin Thalion until he was captured in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears.[3]\nIn the year 488,[4] Lorgan's Men and Orcs launched an attack on the Elves that attempted to guide the sixteen-year-old Tuor to the south. Tuor was captured, and held as a servant by Lorgan for three years. During that time, Lorgan treated Tuor worse than his other thralls because he was related to his former lords and \"he sought to break\u2026the pride of the House of Hador\". Despite this, however, Tuor endured it all \"with watchful patience\" until Lorgan slightly lightened \"his lot\".[2]\nIn the year 491,[4] when Lorgan sent Tuor \"with other thralls on an errand\", he slew his guards \"and fled into the hills\".[2] Despite the Eastrons hunting for him with hounds, Tuor managed to escape and hide out in the caves of Androth.[2] He harried the hills of Mithrim as an outlaw,[4] and Lorgan put a price on his head.[5] In the year 494, Lorgan heard of Ni\u00ebnor's beauty and desired to take her by force. However, Morwen and her daughter managed to escape to Doriath, seeking the news of T\u00farin.[6] In the spring[7] of 495,[5] Tuor disappeared from the north and Lorgan surely never discovered why his foe had vanished: Tuor had set out through the Gate of the \u00d1oldor on a journey that would lead him to Turgon in Gondolin.[3]\nTwenty-eight years after the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad, Lorgan and the Eastrons, along with the enslaved Men of Dor-l\u00f3min, were deceived into believing that H\u00farin was in league with Morgoth. When H\u00farin was released from Thangorodrim in the year 500,[8] he was sent to the border of Hithlum riding with a guard of soldiers as if in high honor. The Eastrons avoided adversity with H\u00farin to maintain Morgoth's trust, and allowed him to roam about in Lorgan's lands untouched. H\u00farin's bitterness was increased and even if he had wished he could not have roused a rebellion.[1]\nIn time, H\u00farin acquired a small following, composed of Asgon and six others. Deciding to leave Hithlum, H\u00farin marched up to Lorgan's halls to look upon him and his Men in scorn and to announce his departure from Hithlum. Lorgan was glad that H\u00farin was going and asked his \"friend\" to tell Morgoth that H\u00farin had not been ill-treated during his stay. H\u00farin rejected Lorgan's friendship and announced that his supposed service under Morgoth was a lie. At this, Lorgan's Eastrons drew swords to kill H\u00farin but Lorgan restrained them. Due to being more cunning and wicked than the others, Lorgan perceived that Morgoth pretended pity for the steadfastness of H\u00farin, letting him go free so as to unwittingly spread his malice. Afterwards, Lorgan told H\u00farin to leave, but wished him ill.[1]",

She was a woman of incomparable beauty and grace, with night-dark hair, sparkling grey eyes, luminous skin, and a clear heartbreakingly lovely voice that was said to cause winter to melt into spring - \"the song of L\u00fathien released the bonds of winter, and the frozen waters spoke, and flowers sprang from the cold earth where her feet had passed\".\nShe often enjoyed dancing in the woods of the realm to the music of her good friend Daeron's flute. He himself soon came to love her jealously, though she would not return it.\nBeren and L\u00fathien plighting their troth within Doriath, by Kip Rasmussen\nQuest for the Silmaril[]\nL\u00fathien was remembered in the Lay of Leithian as the first immortal woman to ever fall in love and marry a mortal man, who in her case was Beren, a man of the House of B\u00ebor whom she met in the woods of Doriath. Their relationship was unlikely from the beginning: L\u00fathien was not only the cherished single daughter of the most powerful Elven King in Beleriand, but also the daughter of a Maia, a powerful angelic being of the race of the Ainur. Beren was a mortal man on the run from the first Dark Lord Morgoth.\nL\u00fathien singing for Morgoth in his throne-room, by Ralph Damiani\nThingol was determined to forbid Beren marry his daughter, and gave him an impossible task as the bride price: Beren had to bring to Thingol one of the Silmarils from Morgoth's iron crown. Against monstrous odds, including being kidnapped by the Sons of F\u00ebanor and the death of Finrod Felagund, as well as a confrontation with Sauron, the couple achieved the task with help from Huan, the Hound of Valinor - but Beren died as soon as the task was completed. In grief, L\u00fathien soon lay down and died, passing to the Halls of Mandos. There, in her grief, she sang to the Vala Mandos. Her song was of such beauty that Mandos, for the first and only time in his existence, was moved to pity. But Mandos had no authority to allow Beren to live again, so he went before Manw\u00eb for advice, who in turn sought out the counsel of Eru Il\u00favatar himself. Two choices were then placed before L\u00fathien: she could either dwell in Valmar with the Valar in bliss forever, as reward for all that she had accomplished, or she could be restored to earthly life again with Beren, on the condition that they would both be mortal and die the death of Men. For her love for Beren, L\u00fathien chose the latter.[2]\n\nLater years[]\nAfter this, she became a mortal and returned to life with Beren, dwelling briefly on Tol Galen. They had a son, Dior, who was called El\u00fachil, the Heir of Thingol.[3]\nAnd thus in anguish Beren paid\nfor that great doom upon him laid,\nthe deathless love of L\u00fathien,\ntoo fair for love of mortal Men;\nand in his doom was L\u00fathien snared,\nthe deathless in his dying shared;\nand Fate them forged a binding chain\nof living love and mortal pain.\n\u2014 The Lays of Beleriand, \"The Doom of L\u00fathien\"\n\"Beren and L\u00fathien: Drawn Back to Life\", by Justin Gerard\nAfter the sack of Menegroth, Beren ambushed the Dwarves responsible and took the Nauglam\u00edr back to L\u00fathien. Her beauty combined with the splendor of the Silmaril and necklace to make her home of Tol Galen the fairest land ever to have existed east of Valinor. On her death, the Nauglam\u00edr was delivered to her son Dior, which led to the ruin of Doriath.[4]\nLegacy[]\nThe union of Beren and L\u00fathien was the first between a mortal Man and a maid with Elven heritage. Her granddaughter Elwing married Earendil, son of Tuor and Idril, thus becoming the great-grandmother of Elrond and Elros, the first being one of the most influential figures of the Second and Third Age and the second the first King of N\u00famenor. Her lineage passed down to the royal House of Elros of N\u00famenor, and then through Silmari\u00ebn to the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb and the House of Elendil. When Aragorn II and Arwen married, the two lines of L\u00fathien's descendants were reunited, continuing her bloodline on to the Kings of the Reunited Kingdom and beyond. L\u00fathien's romance with Beren is one of the great stories of the Elder Days, and is mirrored by the later romance between Aragorn and Arwen Evenstar. According to legend, her line would never be broken as long as the world lasted.[2]\nDue to everything she experienced from her decision to become mortal, Elwing decided upon the fate of the Elves for her and her husband, as she did not want to experience the same fate as her grandmother.",

It was noted that, of all F\u00ebanor's sons, he alone bore semblance to his mother by way of his red hair. It would be seen throughout his life that he inherited too some significant portion of her temperament, as unlike most of his brothers, he generally was neither quick to anger nor rash in his actions.\nAfter the flight of F\u00ebanor from Tirion in Valinor, he went with his father to Formenos. When Morgoth killed Finw\u00eb and stole F\u00ebanor's beloved Silmarils, Maedhros was the first son to take the terrible Oath of F\u00ebanor to recover the holy jewels.[4]\nMaedhros participated in the First Kinslaying alongside his father and brothers. He was, however, the only one of F\u00ebanor's sons to not participate in the burning of the Teleri ships, and he advocated for ships and oarsmen to return to Aman to ferry Fingolfin's host. When his father instead destroyed the ships, Maedhros did not object aloud, but instead stonily watched as the vessels burned.[4] After landing in Middle-earth, the \u00d1oldor were attacked by an army of Orcs, leading to the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. The Elves were victorious and the remnants of the Orcish army retreated to Angband, pursued by F\u00ebanor and a small vanguard. But F\u00ebanor's force encountered a number of Balrogs as they approached Angband, and were quickly slain. F\u00ebanor himself was dealt a mortal wound by Gothmog, the Lord of the Balrogs, but Maedhros and his brothers arrived with a relief force to rescue him. However, F\u00ebanor died from his wounds soon thereafter.\nMaedhros captured by Melkor's orcs, by Jenny Dolfen\nSoon after the Dagor-nuin-Giliath and the death of F\u00ebanor, an embassy came from Morgoth acknowledging defeat, and offering terms which included the possibility of surrendering a Silmaril. Maedhros did not trust Morgoth, and so went to meet his embassy with more force than agreed upon. But Morgoth too expected treachery, and so sent further more troops, and amongst them were Balrogs. When the two groups met, the Elves were quickly slain by the Balrogs and Maedhros was captured. Morgoth then sent word to the Elves that if they forsook their war against him, Maedhros would be released. But the Elves knew that Morgoth would not honor his word and sent no reply. In response, Morgoth hung Maedhros by the wrist of his right hand to the face of a precipice of Thangorodrim with a band of unbreakable steel.[5] Shortly thereafter the host of Fingolfin, betrayed by F\u00ebanor and abandoned in Aman, came at last to Middle-earth. The people of Fingolfin, harboring great anger over F\u00ebanor's betrayal, were not welcomed by F\u00ebanor's host for shame, and the two groups remained bitterly divided. However, Maedhros's cousin Fingon decided to set out alone in the hope of rescuing him. Though Fingon did not know of Maedhros's objection to the burning of the ships at Losgar, the two had been dear friends before F\u00ebanor's betrayal, and Fingon wished to both heal the division between the two hosts and to rescue his cousin.\nMaedhros, by Anna Lee\nFingon rescuing Maedhros from one of the Thangorodrim, by Rick Ritchie\nThe recent appearance of the Sun and Moon had prompted Morgoth to blanket the sky above Angband with nigh-impenetrable clouds of ash and smoke, to shield his servants. However, his legions were at that time still too daunted by the new lights to emerge from Angband, and remained underground. Aided by the ashen darkness and absence of Morgoth's servants above ground, Fingon reached Thangorodrim unassailed. Seeing that he could not enter Angband by any means, he began to sing a song in defiance of the Orcs hiding within Angband. Maedhros heard this song, and began to sing with Fingon, and thus Fingon located him upon Thangorodrim's slopes. But when he reached the foot of the precipice from which Maedhros hung, Fingon found that it was completely sheer, and he could not reach his cousin. In agony without hope of respite, Maedhros begged Fingon to shoot him. Fingon made to do, and prayed to Manw\u00eb to grant speed to his arrow for Maedhros's sake. Fingon's plea was heard by Thorondor, King of Eagles, who appeared swiftly and stayed Fingon's hand, and lifted him up to Maedhros. But Fingon was neither able affect the metal band from which Maedhros hung nor draw it from the precipice. Maedhros again begged Fingon for death, but Fingon instead severed Maedhros\u2018s hand above the wrist, and Thorondor bore them both away. Maedhros swiftly recovered but never forgot his torment, which drove him to become an even deadlier swordsman with his left hand than he had ever been with his right. In gratitude for his rescue and in atonement for F\u00ebanor's betrayal, Maedhros relinquished all claim as Finw\u00eb's heir, and made his uncle Fingolfin, Fingon's father, High King of the \u00d1oldor. Maedhros' brothers resented this, but he openly defended this decision as being proper, as Fingolfin was the oldest living son of Finw\u00eb and was therefore next in line.\nMaedhros after his capture, by Maureval\nSeeing that the more ill-tempered of his brothers were likely to cause feuds with their kinsmen, Maedhros moved all of them and their people out of Hithlum, and later ruled the lands around the Hill of Himring,[6] which became known as the March of Maedhros. He established there a mighty fortress, not only to separate his rash and fiery brothers from the people of Fingolfin, but because he wished to have any attack from Angband fall first upon him. Allied with Fingolfin, he helped the High King win the battle of Dagor Aglareb. He stood with Fingolfin for nearly 300 years until the Dagor Bragollach, and thanks to his daring deeds during the battle, Himring stood while many other Elven realms fell. After a time, he even managed to re-secure the Pass of Aglond over which the fortress of Himring stood, and denied the forces of Morgoth entry into Beleriand through the March.\nSoon after, he learned of Beren and L\u00fathien's successful quest to liberate a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. Realizing that Morgoth was not invincible, he took hope and gathered his brothers and united with other Elven Houses to create the Union of Maedhros, hoping to end the dominion of Morgoth forever. However, the Union was utterly broken during the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad. Himring was captured by Orcs, and Maedhros and his brothers fled south, taking refuge upon the hill of Amon Ereb.[7]\nMaedhros and Maglor prepared to fight and die after stealing the Silmarils after the War of Wrath\nSeveral years later, Maedhros and his brothers learned that Dior of Doriath, son of L\u00fathien and Beren, had inherited the Silmaril that her grandparents had recovered from Morgoth. Still driven by the Oath, Maedhros allowed Celegorm to convince him to attack Doriath. During the battle, Celegorm, Caranthir, and Curufin were slain, as was Dior, King of Doriath. Dior's sons, Elur\u00e9d and Elur\u00edn, were captured and abandoned by Celegorm's cruel servants in the forests around Doriath. Maedhros bitterly regretted this deed, and he long searched for the innocent youths but could not find them.[8] After learning that Dior's daughter Elwing had survived and had taken the Silmaril with her, he and his surviving brothers descended with an army upon the remnants of the people of Doriath living in the Havens of Sirion. The \u00d1oldorin princes killed many Elves and captured Elwing's sons Elrond and Elros in the sack, but she and her husband E\u00e4rendil escaped to the West with the jewel.[9] Heartsick with the burden of the Oath and the deeds he had participated in to see it fulfilled, Maedhros and his brother Maglor took Elwing's sons under their protection.\nMaedhros' last moments, by Lucife56\nAfter the War of Wrath, he and his last surviving brother, Maglor, demanded the jewels from E\u00f6nw\u00eb but were denied, as they were judged by the Maia to be unworthy of the jewels due to their heinous acts. However, driven onward by the Oath, Maedhros convinced Maglor of the necessity of fulfilling it. As such, one night the two brothers snuck into the camp of the victorious Host of Valinor, slew the guard around the jewels and laid hands upon them. The camp was roused, and the brothers prepared to die defending their claim, but E\u00f6nw\u00eb ordered the brothers to be spared, and they left the camp unharmed. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned Maglor's and Maedhros' hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maedhros cast himself and the Silmaril he carried into a fiery chasm in the Earth.[9]\nMaedhros casts himself in the fiery chasm, by Jenny Dolfen\n",

        "biography": "Aredhel had left Gondolin to wander through Beleriand, and in the woods of Nan Elmoth, she met E\u00f6l, and stayed with him, eventually giving birth to Maeglin. E\u00f6l gave his child the name Maeglin when he was twelve. His mother told him about Gondolin and its people throughout his childhood and he desired to see his related kin in the Hidden City. He and his mother soon grew weary and discontented with their life in Nan Elmoth and E\u00f6l's strict shunning of the outside world. When Aredhel finally decided to leave E\u00f6l, she took her son (who stole his father's sword, Anguirel, forged of meteor iron) with her and returned to Gondolin. However, E\u00f6l had followed her, and in judgement before Turgon, he attempted to kill Maeglin with a poisoned dart, but hit Aredhel instead. She died, and E\u00f6l was cast down to his death from the city walls.\nMaeglin was now an orphan, but Turgon held him in honor, and Maeglin both learned and taught much. He became an elven-prince held in high esteem, even leading his own noble house. He found rich loads of metals in the Echoriad surrounding the city and forged weapons of steel stronger than had been seen before. His mine in the Echoriath was named Anghabar, \"Iron Mine\". In the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad, Maeglin refused to remain behind as regent, and went forth to battle with Turgon. The seventh and final gate of Gondolin, the Great Gate of Steel, was Maeglin's creation.\nEven though Maeglin was one of the mighty of Gondolin, his greatest desire was to take Turgon's daughter Idril to be his wife. But his desire was in vain, for Idril was his own first cousin, and as such was considered by Elven society to be too close in kinship with Maeglin to allow for any romantic relationship. Additionally, Idril was well aware of Maeglin's thoughts concerning her and despised him for it.\nWhen Tuor came, carrying Ulmo's warning of the danger to Gondolin, Maeglin sat on the right hand of Turgon and argued against Tuor. The arguments made by Maeglin were instrumental in convincing Turgon not to leave Gondolin despite Ulmo's warnings, which ultimately resulted in the near-complete slaughter of the city's people. Seven years later, Tuor and Idril were wed and Idril bore a son, E\u00e4rendil, further increasing Maeglin's hate. Some time later, Maeglin was captured by Orcs while seeking for metals outside of the Encircling Mountains. He was brought to Angband and taken before Morgoth himself, who knew that Maeglin dwelt in Gondolin and was eager to learn its location. He threatened Maeglin with unimaginable torment, and though Maeglin was no craven, he was cowed by Morgoth's threats and betrayed the location and weaknesses of Gondolin in exchange for his freedom. Morgoth was overjoyed to obtain this information, and to further encourage Maeglin and ensure both his silence and his further aid, Morgoth promised him both rule of the city and the hand of Idril once Turgon was overthrown. Maeglin assented eagerly to this bargain. Afterwards, Morgoth released him and he returned to Gondolin without suspicion. When the hosts of Morgoth attacked and overran the city, Maeglin sought to capture Idril and fought with Tuor on the walls. But Tuor prevailed, and threw him from the wall to his death.\nMaeglin was a relatively young elf, being merely 190 years old at the time of his death.[1]",

F\u00ebanor managed to disperse the armies of Morgoth but pressed on to Angband without his sons. F\u00ebanor was mortally wounded in an attack by Balrogs and his sons bore his body back to Mithrim. As they drew near Eithel Sirion, F\u00ebanor passed away after cursing Morgoth thrice.[3]\nMaglor and his brothers traveled toward the east of Beleriand. Maglor founded the area between the hills surrounding Himring and Blue Mountains, called Maglor's Gap.[4] Years later, the dragon Glaurung passed Maglor's Gap and destroyed the lands about. Maglor and his people fled to Himring to join Maedhros before the Dagor Bragollach took place.[5]\nAfter the Dagor Bragollach, the peoples of B\u00f3r and Ulfang came into Beleriand. They and their sons swore allegiance to Maedhros and Maglor.[5]\nMaglor at the harp, with Maedhros, by Maureval\nFollowing the taking of the Silmaril by Beren and L\u00fathien, Maedhros had formed the Union of Maedhros, an alliance between Elves and Men. Under him, Maedhros' host held the east to draw out the army of Angband while Fingon and his host would attack from the west. During the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad, Ulfang betrayed the Eldar and Edain. Maglor slew Uldor, son of Ulfang. The Union of Maedhros was broken and though the brethren were all wounded, none were slain. They escaped to Mount Dolmed in the east. After the battle, they took up a woodland life in Ossiriand.[6]\nMaglor and his brothers learned when Dior, the new King of Doriath, possessed a Silmaril and refused to give them the jewel that had been won by Beren and worn by L\u00fathien. In the Sack of Doriath, Maglor's younger brothers Celegorm, Curufin and Caranthir were killed, and the Silmaril was not recovered.[7]\nAfterwards, Maglor and his surviving brothers dwelt on Amon Ereb in East Beleriand. Hearing that Elwing, the wife of E\u00e4rendil, had escaped from Doriath with the Silmaril and was now living at the Havens of Sirion, the brothers did not act at once, repenting against their destruction of Doriath. But after a time, remembering their oath, they sent messages to the Havens of Sirion that offered friendship while demanding that the Silmaril be returned to them. And when these demands were refused, they mounted an attack on the Havens with their remaining followers, thus perpetrating the Third Kinslaying that resulted from the accursed Oath of F\u00ebanor.\nMaglor by the sea, by Marya Filatova\nThough they won the fight, after spilling much of their kin's blood, they did not obtain the Silmaril for Elwing escaped over the Great Sea with it. After the carnage of the cruel bloodletting, Maglor and his brother Maedhros came upon the two young sons of E\u00e4rendil and Elwing, Elrond and Elros. With so much blood already on his hands, Maglor took pity on them and would not allow them to be slain. So, in the absence of their parents, he took them into his household and raised them as if they were his own children.[8]\nMaglor regretting for his sins by the sea, by Lucife56\nAfter the War of Wrath, Maglor and his last surviving brother Maedhros stole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the Valar from Morgoth, even though initially Maglor tried to dissuade his older brother from doing this. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor and Maedhros's hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maglor cast his Silmaril into the sea. Thereafter, as the legend claims, he wandered along the shores of the world singing laments over the loss of the Silmaril, until he faded from memory.[8] In fact, however, Maglor perhaps could meet his death casting himself into the Sea out of despair and regret.[9]\n",

However, Manthor was related to Brandir through Halmir's daughter Hiril, who was the grandmother of Manthor and the sister of Halmir's son Haldir, who in turn was the grandfather of Brandir. This meant that Manthor's kinship with Brandir was worth less in the eyes of the people of Haleth, and he lost the election. And Hardang too was related to Brandir, as Brandir was his second-cousin through Halmir's other son Hundar, the brother of Haldir and the grandfather of Hardang. Hence, Hardang was the victor in the election, and he appointed Manthor to be the Master of the North-march at the Crossings of Taeglin.

Manthor successfully defended H\u00farin there, and revealed Hardang's corrupted loyalty to the people, which led to a revolt.\nDeath[]\nManthor died in woods next to Nen Girith, by an arrow-wound from Daruin, who earlier had turned against him and broken his command. This took place after the revolt at the trial, during which Daruin had tried three times to slay Manthor with an arrow.",

His Stewardship began during the last part of the reign of King E\u00e4rnil II and throughout the reign of E\u00e4rnur, E\u00e4rnil's son.\nDuring E\u00e4rnur's reign as king, Mardil was charged with the difficult task of restraining the desire of E\u00e4rnur to fight the Witch-king of Angmar, the chief of the Ringwraiths, who accused E\u00e4rnur after the Battle of Fornost of being afraid to fight him.\nThe King of Minas Morgul (one of the titles of the Witch-king of Angmar) reminded E\u00e4rnur of this and challenged him at the start of his reign in TA 2043. Although an angry E\u00e4rnur wanted to fight the Morgul lord he was restrained with difficulty by Mardil. However, when the Witch-king issued another challenge with great insult seven years later in TA 2050, Mardil could not restrain E\u00e4rnur, who then rode to Minas Morgul and was never seen again.[4]\nE\u00e4rnur did not marry and thus had no children, so Mardil took it upon himself to rule Gondor. There was no one with a clear and unassailable claim to the throne, so the rule of the Stewards was a way of averting civil war. Because the fate of the King was unknown, Mardil made an oath to rule until \"the King returns\". This oath would be sworn by all of the Ruling Stewards. Mardil ruled Gondor with a steady hand and earned the nickname Voronw\u00eb, which means \"the Steadfast\" in Quenya.\nDuring his rule, the Watchful Peace began when Sauron retreated from Dol Guldur in TA 2063 and went into hiding in the East. Upon Mardil's death in TA 2080 at the age of 120 years old, his son Eradan succeeded him as the second Ruling Steward of Gondor.\nAfter Mardil's rule his successors stopped using High-elven names in their official names.[2]",

Through Marhari his father, he was also a direct descendant of Vidugavia, 'King of Rhovanion'.\nMarhwini's father Marhari first aligned his people with Gondor in a fight with the Wainriders called the Battle of the Plains. In that conflict, King Narmacil II of Gondor was slain, as was Marhari. Marhwini then led a remnant of what remained of the Northmen to the vales of Anduin, where they mixed with fugitives escaped from the east. These people would come to be known as the \u00c9oth\u00e9od, they were the culture that would become the Rohirrim.\nDuring the reign of King Calimehtar of Gondor, Marhwini sent word to Gondor that a host of Wainriders was preparing to assault the land of Calenardhon (later Rohan). Eager to avenge Gondor's prior defeat by the Wainriders, Calimehtar led an army out of Gondor and joined with Northmen under Marhwini. The combined force overwhelmed the Wainriders' army at the Second Battle of Dagorlad. As Marhwini had hoped, many thralls of the Wainriders who had once been among the Northmen revolted, and caused their captor's settlements to be destroyed. As the Wainriders retreated from battle, they were forced to retreat far to the east, having been defeated and driven from their homes. Thus the \u00c9oth\u00e9od were for a time victorious although the power of the Wainriders was only checked and not destroyed.\nHe had a son named Forthwini.[1]",

Subsequently, Thorin declared the return of the King under the Mountain. This news quickly spread throughout the town and the people began to shout, sing, and rejoice. The Master doubted that there ever was a 'King under the Mountain', and doubted even more so that it was Thorin, but he had to take heed of the clamour. Therefore, he pretended to believe Thorin's story, and the Master yielded his own great chair to him. The Master figured that the Dwarves would stay without fulfilling their promises, and then he could comfortably boot them out. The Master accommodated the Dwarves and Bilbo Baggins for two weeks before they thought about departing for the Lonely Mountain. The Master was shocked that Thorin would dare to approach Smaug and he wondered whether he really was who he said he was. All the same, he was more than willing to let them go because they were expensive to keep, and their arrival had caused business to come to a standstill. Alongside his councilors, the Master \"bade them farewell from the great steps of the town-hall\".[2]\nThe Master of Lake-town, acted by Stephen Fry\nWhen Smaug attacked Lake-town, the people urged the Master to tell them what needed to be done. But as the flames leaped from the dragon's jaw, the Master fled in his gilded boat. Thus it was that Bard took control of the situation and ultimately slew the dragon himself. The surviving townsfolk gathered on the western shore of the Long Lake and lamented at the loss of their home. The people then directed their anger at the Master, accusing him of selfishness and calling him \"Moneybags\". They demanded that Bard become their king. In response, the Master, in a demonstration of his charisma and oratorical prowess, rebutted the people and convinced them that their anger should be directed towards Thorin and Company instead of him. The Master remained quiet as the survivors set up camps along the shore and Bard assumed effective control of all the people but did so only in the Master's name. When the hosts of Esgaroth and the Elvenking set off for Erebor to demand their share in the treasure, the Master did not go. Those who stayed behind began to prepare for the oncoming winter by building huts and collecting resources; meanwhile, the Master directed the process of planning a new town.[1]\nAfter the Battle of Five Armies, Bard gave a large amount of gold to the Master for the help of the Lake-people. However, the Master caught the 'dragon-sickness', stole most of the gold and fled with it from Lake-town.[3] After his companions had deserted him, he starved to death in the Waste[3] sometime between TA 2941 and TA 2949. According to Balin, the new Master of Lake-town was wiser and very popular, because the people gave him the credit for the prosperity as much wealth went up and down the River Running.[3]"

He had three older siblings, all sisters.\nAfter the War of the Last Alliance in which his father An\u00e1rion was slain, Meneldil was groomed by his uncle Isildur for a few years to rule Gondor, since Isildur and his sons intended to go north to rule Arnor. According to Unfinished Tales, Meneldil was farsighted and well-pleased at the planned departure of Isildur and his sons, hoping that affairs in the north would keep them occupied.  Meneldil became the third King of Gondor in TA 2 after the death of Isildur in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields.  Meneldil was the first King of Gondor who ruled independently from the High Kingdom of the D\u00fanedain, Arnor.\nIt is uncertain whether Meneldil was King by right, as young cousin Valandil would have had the better claim as High King of Gondor and Arnor, but no claim by Valandil was ever made. It was in any case unlikely that Meneldil would give up his right to rule to a much younger cousin he had never seen. In any case, the people of Gondor did not resist Meneldil's claim to the throne, and King Valandil and his heirs made no serious attempt to regain control over Gondor until the death of King Ondoher and his heirs. In effect, Meneldil thus severed Gondor from Arnor, but the title of High King remained with the northern line.\nMeneldil died in TA 158\u00a0after one hundred fifty-six years of rule and two hundred eighty-one years of life\u00a0and was succeeded by his son Cemendur. No notable events occurred in his reign, suggesting it was a peaceful reign.[2]",

After visiting many places on the island, including the Cottage of Lost Play, Littleheart, the son of Voronw\u00eb brought him to Meril's house, where Eriol requested to taste limp\u00eb, a magic Elven drink, seeking kinship and fellowship with the Elves.[6]\nMeril denied, telling him that it is dangerous for a mortal Man to do so, as Il\u00favatar made his Children different, and drinking limp\u00eb would erase his old desires but awake new ones; she also warned him that he would one day long for his lands again.[2] To explain better she told him the stories of The Chaining of Melko[2] and The Coming of the Elves and the Making of K\u00f4r.[6]\nSome time after, Meril visited the Cottage of Lost Play during a festival, before Eriol went to Tavrobel, where Littleheart told the tale of the Fall of Gondolin.[7]\nThe Faring Forth[]\nAccording to one outline for the continuation of the Lost Tales, the disastrous Faring Forth, the great expedition to the Great Lands for the rescue of the Lost Elves, was instigated prematurely by Eriol himself against Meril's command, who, longing for his home, returned to the Great Lands and \"preached\" of the Faring Forth. Thus, due to Eriol's impatience and recklessness, the Faring Forth was doomed to fail.[8]\nNothing else is known about Meril, or her fate after the Second Faring Forth.",

        "biography": "Earlier years at Nargothrond[]\n\"For M\u00eem came of Dwarves that were banished in ancient days from the great Dwarf-cities of the east, and long before the return of Morgoth they wandered westward into Beleriand.\"\n\u2014The Silmarillion, Quenta Silmarillion, \"Of T\u00farin Turambar\"\nOn the Narog river was a series of caves settled by the Petty-dwarves which they had named Narukuth\u00fbn[3].[4] By the year 52, only a remnant led by M\u00eem, their chieftain, lingered there, and they aided Finrod who sought to make a strong place that would be comparable to Menegroth. They were generously rewarded by Finrod for this.[5][6] Eventually Finrod had further help from the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains in extending the fortress, but these Great Dwarves despised the Petty-dwarves and had no compunction in ousting them, especially when it was for great rewards. M\u00eem developed a special hatred for the Elves because of this.[7] M\u00eem would then attempt to murder Finrod in his sleep, but this failed and he was driven out along with the rest of his people into the wild.[6]\nAt some point M\u00eem relocated to another Petty-dwarf settlement, Bar-en-Nibin-noeg beneath Sharbhund in Methiriad, where caves had been deepened and bored far under the hill during the long years that the Petty-dwarves had dwelt there. These cavernous halls were spacious enough to house a hundred or more at need.[8]\nEncounter with T\u00farin[]\n\"But now at last they had dwindled and died out of Middle-earth, all save M\u00eem and his two sons; and M\u00eem was old even in the reckoning of Dwarves, old and forgotten.\"\n\u2014The Children of H\u00farin, Of M\u00eem the Dwarf\nIn the year 486, M\u00eem and his sons, Ibun and Kh\u00eem, were out gathering in a place of many great stones, leaning or tumbled together. They may have been seeking for old treasures of a dwarf-house near these flat stones, and been carrying ingots of gold in heavy sacks which had been disguised.[9] Unluckily, they were spotted by a band of roaming outlaws who then pursued them, with one of the outlaws, Andr\u00f3g, shooting at them with his bow. While Ibun and Kh\u00eem managed to escape into the dusk, M\u00eem lagged behind and was seized, though he struggled and bit like a beast, wounding Andr\u00f3g's hand. Andr\u00f3g assumed that M\u00eem was either an Orc or was of Orc-kin, and should be killed. This sentiment was echoed by another outlaw, Ulrad, who felt cheated upon finding that M\u00eem's sack seemingly only contained roots and small stones. The leader of the outlaws, Neithan, stayed them however, and bid for M\u00eem to be let up and permitted to speak.[8]\n\"M\u00eem the dwarf\" by Anke Ei\u00dfmann\nM\u00eem pleaded that he was old and poor, and for T\u00farin to not let him be slain without cause. When T\u00farin asked him what he could offer in ransom and noted that they were looking for a dwelling, M\u00eem offered to share his dwelling with them. T\u00farin accepted this, and swore to him that if they were brought there without trickery, then he would not be slain by any of the outlaws. Since it was late and dark, M\u00eem initially wished to depart and return for them the next day, but T\u00farin denied this without the pledge of his sack. When M\u00eem refused to be parted from it, T\u00farin had him brought to their camp despite M\u00eem cursing in Khuzd\u00fbl along the way; when they arrived, the outlaws put bonds on his legs, at which point he stopped cursing.[8]\nThe next morning, they released M\u00eem, and he declared that he would not forgive them for it tried to take back his promise. T\u00farin responded that M\u00eem still had to lead them to his home, and then stared into M\u00eem's eyes until M\u00eem could no longer endure it; he then beckoned for T\u00farin and the outlaws to follow him.[8]\nM\u00eem spent the day guiding the outlaws, marching to Amon R\u00fbdh. Once there, they climbed through hidden and perilous paths until they eventually arrived at the entrance to Bar-en-Nibin-noeg. After bidding them to enter, M\u00eem renamed the dwelling to Bar-en-Danwedh. As they entered, Ibun approached from around a corner with a small torch and informed M\u00eem in Khuzd\u00fbl that Kh\u00eem had been struck by the earlier arrow, and had just died at sunset. M\u00eem was grieved by this, exclaiming that being held in bondage by the outlaws had prevented him from able to heal his son. T\u00farin, pitying M\u00eem, claimed that he now held himself in M\u00eem's debt, promising that he would pay M\u00eem a heavy ransom of gold from any wealth he came by. Though M\u00eem marveled at T\u00farin\u2019s promise, he demanded that Andr\u00f3g break his bow and arrows and lay them at his sons feet; he further cursed Andr\u00f3g that he shall never again take arrow or bow, otherwise he shall die by it. Andr\u00f3g begrudgingly did this, but cursed M\u00eem in turn that he would die with a dart in his throat.[8]\n\"T\u00farin and his Band are Led to Amon R\u00fbdh\" by Ted Nasmith\nThe next day, M\u00eem stated that he and Ibun would serve as guides when the Men went out, sharing his earth-bread with all of them except Ulrad because he had been the one who put bonds upon him earlier. The outlaws remained there for the rest of year, going on no more raids and only stirring abroad for hunting or gathering of food. While M\u00eem tolerated them, the outlaws eventually became uneasy about sharing the dwelling with M\u00eem, as he would often appear out of some shadowy corner or doorway when they thought he was elsewhere. It was otherwise for T\u00farin however, as he became ever more friendly to M\u00eem, often sitting for hours listening to his councils, lore, and tales of his life. As a result, M\u00eem became pleased by this, and sometimes allowed T\u00farin to enter his smithy.[8]\nIn midwinter, Beleg the Elf, a dear friend of T\u00farin, suddenly came among them, bearing great items such as the Helm of Hador and lembas from Melian.[8] M\u00eem hated Beleg, as he was one of the Sindar, the Elves hated the most. This hatred grew as he became jealous of the love that T\u00farin bore to Beleg and it became fiercer when Beleg seemingly undid the curse he had laid on Andr\u00f3g: the outlaw had taken up bow again, and was struck by a poisoned orc-arrow, but his life was saved by Beleg.[10] At one point, M\u00eem theorized that if he ate some lembas, he would renew his youth and grow strong again. However, since he could not obtain it stealthily, he feigned sickness and begged for it from Beleg, only for the Elf to refuse. This set the seal on M\u00eem's hatred.[11]\nTogether, T\u00farin and Beleg did great deeds and pushed back Morgoth's forces, but in response Morgoth sent a great many spies to locate their hideout. M\u00eem became aware of the presence of Orcs in the lands around Amon R\u00fbdh, and he and his son Ibun soon became ensnared with them. Differing tales speak of this being either an intentional act by M\u00eem due to the hatred he bore against Beleg, or unintentional due to Ibun being captured and threatened with torture. Either way, M\u00eem agreed to lead Morgoth's forces to T\u00farin's hiding place, but on the following conditions: that he be paid the weight of iron for any Man they caught or slew, but of T\u00farin and Beleg in gold; for M\u00eem's house be left to him; for Beleg be left bound for M\u00eem to deal with; and for T\u00farin to be let go free. The emissary of Morgoth readily agreed, though with no real intention of upholding the promises, and insisted that Ibun be kept as a hostage. M\u00eem became afraid at this and tried to back out, but with the Orcs holding Ibun, he was obliged to guide them.[10]\nM\u00eem led the Orcs through the secret paths, resulting in the sacking of the hideout. All of the outlaws were struck down, with Andr\u00f3g being mortally wounded by an arrow, and T\u00farin and Beleg captured with nets. Only Andv\u00edr managed to escape. T\u00farin was carried off, but Beleg was left wounded and bound with his wrists and ankles tied to iron pins driven into the rock. M\u00eem, who had been lurking in the caves during the battle, emerged to gloat over Beleg while sharpening a knife. Andr\u00f3g, however, managed to crawl through the dead bodies, seizing a sword which he thrust at the Dwarf. M\u00eem fled, retreating down a steep and difficult goat's path, shrieking in fear.[10]\nReturn to Nargothrond[]\n\"Now Elves and Men shall rue this deed, and because of the death of M\u00eem the dwarf shall death follow this gold so long as it remain on Earth, and a like fate shall every part and portion share with the whole.\"\n\u2014M\u00eem's last words[12]\nEventually in the year 499,[13] after T\u00farin had slain Glaurung, M\u00eem made his way back to ruined Nargothrond. Finding the halls unguarded, he took possession of the hoard, sitting there joyfully while \"fingering the gold and gems\" through his hands. He also sang many \"black songs of enchantment\"[12] to bind the hoard to himself.[14]\nIn the year 502, when a band of outlaws led by H\u00farin, who had witnessed all that had happened to T\u00farin due to being cursed to see with Morgoth's eyes, came to the Doors of Nargothrond, M\u00eem met with them, demanding to know their purpose.[15] When H\u00farin refused to answer, M\u00eem told him of his own history and claim to the hoard, only for H\u00farin to vindicate M\u00eem as partially responsible for T\u00farin's fate.[15] Despite M\u00eem's attempts to beg for his life,[15] H\u00farin slew him.[16]\nHowever, with his dying breath, M\u00eem uttered a final curse on the treasure of Nargothrond. After this, H\u00farin's company then took the treasure to Doriath.[13] As a result of M\u00eem's curse, however, most of the company was slain in quarrels amongst themselves along the way.[14]",

When it became apparent that the inn was in danger, Nob helped with the disguises for their beds and kept watch during the night.[1][2] He was still working at the inn when Frodo and company returned a year later to visit.[3]",

During the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799, N\u00e1in turned the tide of battle when he arrived with a fresh army of Dwarves, who drove through the host of Orcs up to the East-gate of Moria. N\u00e1in stood before the Gate, and in his wrath he cried with a great voice for Azog to come out and face him. Finally Azog appeared, fresh and fully armed, and the two fought. N\u00e1in withstood Azog's assault until, blinded by his great rage, he swung a great stroke with all his strength at Azog. The Orc chief dodged the blow and kicked N\u00e1in\u2019s leg, causing him to fall forward. N\u00e1in's mattock splintered on a nearby stone, and Azog's return swing broke N\u00e1in's neck, killing him.\nAzog didn't have long to celebrate his slaying of the great Dwarf, as his host was in the midst of a great rout. Then, as he attempted to re-enter Moria, the young D\u00e1in Ironfoot leaped up the steps and with his red axe decapitated Azog, avenging his father's death. N\u00e1in\u2019s body was cremated on great wooden pyres along with the other Dwarves who had fallen in the battle. N\u00e1in and the Dwarves who were cremated with him that day were afterward known as the Burned Dwarves of Azanulbizar.[1]",

After years of searching, Olw\u00eb grew impatient, and led the greater part of the Teleri to Valinor, on the insistence of the Vala Ulmo.[2]\nOlw\u00eb became Lord of the island of Tol Eress\u00eba, where the Teleri built a great number of cities, and grew in number. When they finally came to Eldamar some centuries later, Olw\u00eb became Lord of Alqualond\u00eb. His daughter E\u00e4rwen married Finarfin son of Finw\u00eb[2] and later High King of the \u00d1oldor in Valinor, and thus their children, when these returned to Middle-earth, could claim kinship to Thingol, for E\u00e4rwen had several sons.\nWhen F\u00ebanor resolved to return to Middle-earth in pursuit of Morgoth, he came to Alqualond\u00eb and spoke to the Teleri asking for aid and for the use of the Swanships\u00a0but he could not move them. He then grew hot and wrathful and, grudging he spoke to Olw\u00eb, he accused him of renouncing their friendship and for being ungrateful for the help that the \u00d1oldor had given his people in the past. Then Olw\u00eb said to F\u00ebanor that this was not so and that he believed that as a friend it was right for him to keep a friend from doing something unwise. Then he spoke to him of the many things that they accomplished on their own without any aid from the \u00d1oldor, and that the Swanships were one of those things and were very dear to them.[7]\nOlw\u00eb, by Righon\nSeeing that he was not going to get what he wanted, F\u00ebanor waited beyond the walls until he gathered his strength and then in defiance of Olw\u00eb he and his people began manning the ships. His people resisted and a battle had begun and many on both sides were slain, but the Teleri withstood them for a time. Then the host of Fingon arrived and believing that the Teleri had been told to waylay the \u00d1oldor by command of the Valar, joined the battle and the Teleri were overcome. No doubt Olw\u00eb had watched in horror many of his people dying and he could do little for he called upon Oss\u00eb, their patron Maia but there was no answer; all Maia had been forbidden by the Valar to interfere in the \u00d1oldor's departure from Aman. Oss\u00eb would however conjure terrible storms in vengeance for the \u00d1oldor's crimes, sinking many of the stolen ships and drowning their \u00d1oldor crews.[7]\nThe cruel slaying at the havens continued to haunt Olw\u00eb and his people for many years to come. Towards the end of the First Age when the Valar were preparing for the final assault on Morgoth, the Teleri of Olw\u00eb agreed only to sail the ships, but would send no more marriners than were strictly necessary to do so, and none would participate in the coming war.[8]",

Although Arvedui had a strong claim by his way of his wife F\u00edriel, who by ancient N\u00famen\u00f3rean law now should have become Ruling Queen and further claim as a descendant of Isildur and theoretical High King, the throne was granted by Steward Pelendur and the Council of Gondor to the general E\u00e4rnil, a descendant of An\u00e1rion, who would reign as King E\u00e4rnil II.[2]\nOndoher was called Ondohir in the first edition of The Return of the King.[citation needed]",

Orodreth took it, ruling as regent, but the Sons of F\u00ebanor held the real power. When news came that Finrod had been killed, the Sons of F\u00ebanor were expelled from Nargothrond and Orodreth became its next king.[7]\nWhen T\u00farin Turambar arrived in Nargothrond he gradually became its leader and Orodreth held no actual power, even if he was still King in name. High in Orodreth's councils, T\u00farin convinced him to build the Bridge of Nargothrond and abandon their secretive method of warfare in favor of open warfare.[8] In FA 495, Orodreth and T\u00farin marched out to meet the hosts of Morgoth and the Dragon Glaurung at Tumhalad and Orodreth died fighting there, and his realm was subsequently conquered.[9][10]",

After the War of Wrath, he declined to depart Middle-earth as many others did, and instead went over the Blue Mountains with his household. He eventually ended up in Greenwood the Great, where Silvan Elves of Nandorin descent lived, and he was taken by them as lord. His capital was at Amon Lanc.[1]\nWest of Oropher's realm was the realm of L\u00f3rinand across the Anduin, where Amd\u00edr, another Sindar, ruled over Silvan Elves.[1]\nWar of Last Alliance[]\nBefore the War of the Last Alliance, Oropher and his folk left their capital at Amon Lanc and crossed Anduin to live with their kin in L\u00f3rinand. Three times, he moved his people northwards, eventually settling around Emyn Duir, the Mountains of Mirkwood. His retreat northwards was because of his desire to move \"out of range\" from the Dwarves of Khazad-d\u00fbm and avoid the threat of Mordor.[2]\nThough he and his people had little relation with other peoples of Middle-earth, Oropher understood that there could be no lasting peace until Sauron was defeated. Oropher answered the summons for the Last Alliance of Elves and Men but marched as an independent force with Amd\u00edr, King of L\u00f3rien. He joined with Gil-galad's forces as they marched down the Anduin to Dagorlad. Oropher's force was lightly armed and untrained in fighting pitched battles in the open.[1]\nIn the Battle of Dagorlad, Oropher's company fought valiantly, but he was slain with the greater part of his people when he, with King Amd\u00edr and his warriors, called an early charge upon the enemy without orders from the \u00d1oldorin High-king Gil-galad. After Sauron was defeated, Thranduil, Oropher's son and heir, returned to Eryn Galen with the shattered remnants of his people's grand army. Nevertheless, while depleted, his army was still large enough that the Orcs hiding in secret in the Misty Mountains did not dare attack them.[1]",

He effectively ruled the kingdom for one year while observing the claims of the two claimants, Prince Arvedui of Arthedain and the general E\u00e4rnil who was victorious in battle against the Wainriders (Easterlings).\nPelendur dismissed Arvedui's claim maintaining that the rule of Gondor belonged to the heirs of An\u00e1rion, even though Isildur was the High King of both Gondor and Arnor before his death. Arvedui also argued, his wife F\u00edriel, the daughter of Ondoher should rightfully become Ruling Queen due to the old N\u00famenorean law of accession, which stated the eldest remaining child of the king should inherit the throne. Pelendur rejected F\u00edriel's claim saying in N\u00famenor, it was peaceful enough to have women as rulers. However, the Realms in Exile were constantly under attack and therefore needed a male ruler to lead the armies.\nBased on these arguments the Council of Gondor, under the influence of Pelendur, threw out Arvedui's claim and chose E\u00e4rnil as King, in TA 1945 defying the N\u00famen\u00f3rean law of succession. Although Pelendur's choice prevented the heirs of Isildur from reuniting the Realms in Exile, it may have averted another Kin-strife. E\u00e4rnil, the victorious general and a direct male heir of An\u00e1rion, had become a hero in Gondor and had the support of the populace for his deeds in battle. Installing Arvedui, a foreigner, as king could have stirred up resentment amongst the people of the coastlands and the supporters of E\u00e4rnil, who had saved Gondor.\nThis political precedent was one reason for Aragorn's caution in assuming the throne of Gondor at the end of the Third Age.\nWith the accession of King E\u00e4rnil II in TA 1945, Pelendur handed over rule of Gondor to him, and resumed the traditional duties of the office of Steward willingly. Pelendur died in TA 1998 at the age of 119 years old, after his death the Stewardship formally became hereditary and passed to his son Vorondil the Hunter.",

He was also the tallest of the Elves of Gondolin.\nPengolodh escaped the sack of the city with Tuor and Idril's company of survivors, and followed them to the Mouths of Sirion. He is not further mentioned in writing, but since the Annals of Beleriand are attributed to him, as well as the edited Annals of Aman (furthering the work of R\u00famil), he must have stayed in Lindon for at least a while after the War of Wrath, so that the D\u00fanedain could copy his work.\nIt was during his stay at the Mouths of Sirion that Pengolodh did the majority of his work. Is attributed to him the composition of the Lhammas and other prominent linguistic texts from ancient Middle-earth, in which he collected much material concerning also the m\u00e1tengwi\u00eb, the gesture-code of the Elves.[1] Basing on information obtained from the refugees of Doriath, he made copies and extracts of documents written in Cirth, possibly preserving them as an active writing system.\nSecond Age[]\nLater, in the Second Age, he lived in the \u00d1oldorin kingdom of Gil-galad in Lindon. Pengolodh was one of the few Elves admitted into Khazad-d\u00fbm, where he might have learned Khuzd\u00fbl.

Centuries later, \u00c6lfwine spoke with him there.[1] When \u00c6lfwine discovered the island of\u00a0Tol Eress\u00eba\u00a0(c. 900 A.D.) he was told stories by Pengolod or studied his works (and those collected by Pengolod from other authors both Elves and men) and translated them.\nPengolodh's collection also included the writings of R\u00famil and D\u00edrhaval.",

Ragnir was the youngest member of this company.[1] The company crossed the Ered Wethrin and went down the course of the Lithir to the southern end of the Vale of Sirion. There H\u00farin decided to return to Gondolin, but he could not tell his desire to anyone due to his oath of secrecy. Thus, one night near the Brithiach, H\u00farin waited until the others slept and then he fled alone. When the company discovered the escape of H\u00farin, Ragnir suggested to give up the quest and come back to Dor-l\u00f3min, because their lord clearly wanted to flee alone.[1] However, Asgon replied that was their duty to find and follow him everywhere and then suggested to look for him in nearby Brethil, saying that the Men of Brethil were good and that they would welcome them even if they were strangers, since the Lord of Brethil was akin to the House of Hador. Despite Ragnir's pessimism, the company chose to follow Asgon into the forest, because he was notoriously stout and lucky. In the forest the company fell asleep, but they were soon noticed by the march-wardens of Brethil and took captive. In the early morning, they were brought before Ebor, captain of the march-wardens, who claimed that because the Master of the North-march was not with them at that time, he had to bring them before the new Chieftain of Brethil, Hardang son of Hundad. Thus, the prisoners were blindfolded and lead by devious ways to Obel Halad, where Hardang scorned and accused them of spying. Finally, their weapons were taken and the company was ejected from Brethil, because T\u00farin murdered Brandir, but their lives where spared because the Haladin where grateful for the slaying of Glaurung. After guiding them blindfolded back to the North-march, Ebor chose to give them their weapons back, but warned them to not enter Brethil again, or they all would be killed on sight.[1] Once survived this misadventure, Ragnir asked to Asgon what they should do, wryly noting that they were still alive thanks to Asgon's luck. Asgon suggested to go to the Crossings of Taeglin, because he still wanted to seek H\u00farin and hoped that there they will hear news about him. Despite he chose to follow Asgon westwards, once again Ragnir commented that they might instead hear bow-strings and be killed on sight.\nThe final destiny of H\u00farin's company remains unknown, because Tolkien left the tale unfinished.",

After the victory he renamed himself R\u00f3mendacil, meaning \"East-victor\".\nIt was he that created the office of the Steward of Gondor, as a high councilor to the king.[3] When the line of kings failed two thousand years later, the holders of this office would rule Gondor.\nThe peace on Gondor's frontiers was not to last forever: forty years later in TA 541 the Easterlings invaded once more, and R\u00f3mendacil rode to meet them in battle, but was slain.\nHe was succeeded by his son Turambar.[1]",

After Narmacil's death, he remained Regent for ten years under his father Calmacil.\nWhen he finally ascended to the throne after the death of his father, he immediately took the name R\u00f3mendacil (East-victor), as his distant forefather Tarostar had done. He was responsible for the Argonath, the pillars of the Kings. They stood above Nen Hithoel on the Anduin river long into the Fourth Age and appear prominently in The Lord of the Rings.\nTo cement an alliance with the Northmen, R\u00f3mendacil II sent his son Valacar as an ambassador. While Valacar was on his mission he married Vidumavi, the daughter of Vidugavia, the 'King' of Rhovanion.[2] In TA 1260, R\u00f3mendacil summoned him and his Northmen family back to Gondor, to take part in the duties of the realm. This marriage was controversial and would ultimately lead to the disastrous Kin-strife.[3]\nR\u00f3mendacil died in TA 1366 after reigning 62 years and ruling for 126 and was succeeded by Valacar.",

During Bilbo's disappearance, Lobelia and Otho claimed the smial; when Bilbo returned from his adventure with Thorin and Company, Lobelia and Otho were in the midst of auctioning off the contents of Bag End with the firm of Grubb, Grubb and Burrowes.[1]\nAfter Bilbo's eleventy-first birthday party, Lobelia and Otho were incensed that Bilbo had left Bag End to Frodo, a more distant cousin once removed, and questioned the validity of Bilbo's will. Since much of Bilbo's silverware vanished during his adventure with the Dwarves, when Bilbo left the Shire permanently, he gave Lobelia a box of silver spoons labeled \"For Lobelia, from Cousin Bilbo\", as a mathom.[2] Eventually, Lobelia was able to acquire Bag End when Frodo sold it to her for under market value under his ruse of moving to Crickhollow, but by this time Otho had died and was unable to enjoy it.[3]\nDuring the War of the Ring, Lobelia opposed Sharkey after hearing from the Ruffians that they were ordered to build sheds at Bag End. After rudely telling her to step aside, she became enraged and attacked the leader using only her umbrella as a weapon but she lost and was imprisoned in the Lockholes at Michel Delving.[4] Freed after the Scouring of the Shire, Lobelia was greeted with raucous applause due to her spirit in defying Saruman's thuggery, and she was touched as she had never before been popular due to her avarice. However, she was heartbroken over Lotho's murder, and so granted Bag End back to Frodo and what was left of her money hoping he would use it to help hobbits who had lost their homes, due to Sharkey's tyranny. She moved in with her original family, the Bracegirdles of Hardbottle. She died in the spring of 3020, and was over 100 years old.[5]",

        "biography": "Lotho was born in the year SR 1364 to Otho Sackville-Baggins and his wife Lobelia. He, like the rest of his family, was very unpopular and generally disliked in the Shire. Like his father and mother, he had always desired Bag End for himself - in the year SR 1418 of Shire Reckoning he had already waited sixty-two years for the inheritance, but was foiled when Bilbo's nephew Frodo Baggins was bestowed the home.\nIn TA 3012, after Otho had passed away, Lotho came to be considered a wealthy Hobbit through inheriting his father's pipe-weed plantations in the Southfarthing.[1]\nIn TA 3016 or TA 3017, Lotho began to quietly sell away the best Pipe-weed to Men, using great wagons at Sarn Ford, in exchange for money. Most of these Men were Ruffians in the employ of Saruman. Using this money, Lotho began buying up an excessive amount of property including inns, farms, malt-houses, leaf-plantations, and mills, supposedly including the Old Mill; while he kept his activities a secret, rumors of them inevitably spread throughout the Shire.[1]\nIn TA 3018, after Frodo sold Bag End to the Sackville-Baggins, Lotho arrived at Bag End with his mother after lunch on September 23 to inspect their new home.[2] A short time after moving into Bag End, Lotho had the Old Mill torn down, hiring outsiders to build a New Mill, bigger than the old one, in addition to other mills under the guise of grinding corn faster. By December, Lotho's trades with outsiders began to include things beyond just Pipe-weed. As a consequence, things began to become scarce as winter came and people started getting angry. To appease them, Lotho came up with an answer to their struggles; he invited some Ruffians among his buyers to stay in the Shire to assert his dominance. Initially, those harmed by the activities of the Ruffians were compensated by Lotho, but soon enough Lotho could not keep up with the Ruffians. After Will Whitfoot, the Mayor of the Shire, decided to journey to Bag End to confront him in protest, Lotho sent his Men to imprison him in the Lockholes.[1]\nNot that long within the New Year, Lotho declared himself as the Chief Shirriff, calling himself the Chief. With the aid of Sharkey's Men under his command, the Shire became a totalitarian regime. Lotho restricted the inns to the Ruffians, made a new version of The Rules, and sent his Men to gather goods \"for fair distribution\". While anyone who disagreed with him was sent to the Lockholes, there was resistance to his rule. Fredegar Bolger led a band of rebels in the Brockenbores near the Hills of Scary, though Lotho's Men smoked them out, sending them to the Lockholes.[3] In Tookland, Paladin II Took also resisted and the Tooks hunted any Ruffian Lotho sent there.[1]\nEventually however, Lotho's regime came to an end on September 22[4]  when he was stripped of his power after Saruman came to Bag End under the alias of Sharkey. Lotho was stabbed in his sleep by Gr\u00edma at the behest of Saruman (who suggests Gr\u00edma may have eaten him as well). Publicly, Lotho simply disappeared from the public eye and his mother was taken to the Lockholes.[1]",

        "biography": "Sador was one of the Dr\u00faedain who lived within the household of H\u00farin.[6] He became a woodman in his youth and learned how to carve and craft things out of wood. When the Dagor Bragollach broke out in the year 455, Sador was called upon from his tasks in the woods to fight. He came too late to the battle field however, only being able to bring back his fallen lord Hador on a bier. Afterwards, Sador become a soldier, thus being stationed at Eithel Sirion for many years with little to mark them. He was there in the year 462 defending Barad Eithel, when Galdor fell and H\u00farin took up his command, leading them to drive the Orcs back, never coming within sight of Eithel Sirion again. Sometime later, Sador grew tired of war, and obtained leave to return to the woods that he yearned for, becoming a woodman again. Yet tragedy struck when, by ill-luck, he mishandled his axe and accidentally severed his right foot, after which, Sador obtained a crutch and his footless leg had shrunken from a lack of use.[7]\nIn the years that followed, Sador became a retainer[2] and \"house-man in the service of H\u00farin\", working in the outbuildings and fixing things, usually of little importance, that were needed in the house, as he still \"had some skill in the working of wood\". During his time within H\u00farin's household, Sador was befriended by young T\u00farin, the eldest of the children of H\u00farin, who would often help Sador by fetching materials and tools to spare him from walking. Sometimes T\u00farin would bring gifts for him to use that he \"found\" lying around unwatched. As a result, Sador would smile and tell the boy to return them to their proper place, and taught him that he should \"Give with a free hand, but give only your own\". Despite this, Sador often rewarded T\u00farin's kindness, carving for him the figures of men and beasts, although it was Sador's tales that T\u00farin delighted the most.[7]\nSador was wise when sharing his tales with T\u00farin, incorporating many insights about life. When telling T\u00farin of his time as a soldier, he believed that he could have gotten his injury with more honor during the Dagor Bragollach, and remembered how fiery H\u00farin was at Eithel Sirion. He then reflected to T\u00farin that \"a man that flies from his fear may find that he has only taken a short cut to meet it\", as he had fled war only to get an injury during an accident. T\u00farin often called him Labadal in pity for his accident. As T\u00farin grew older, however, Sador began to find many of his questions difficult to answer. One such instance occurred after Urwen died from the Evil Breath when T\u00farin asked him about fate, the difference between Elves and Men, and the nature of death.[7]\nOn T\u00farin's eighth birthday in the month of Gwaeron according to the Edain reckoning, H\u00farin gave him an Elven knife of great worth.[7] T\u00farin pitied Sador and decided to give the gift to him.[7] Sador accepted the gift as it would be rude not to, but he knew he would be unable to repay T\u00farin for such a gift.[7] T\u00farin's mother, Morwen, was not fond of Sador and did not care for him, believing him to be \"self-maimed by his own want of skill\" and \"slow with his tasks\" as well as spending too \"much time on trifles unbidden\". Despite this, however, T\u00farin noted that his act of generosity resulted in Sador being treated more kindly. Around this time Sador set out to carve a great chair for the hall of H\u00farin.[8] He was possibly given this task by H\u00farin instead of choosing to do so of his own accord.[citation needed]\nBefore the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad, H\u00farin left to go to war in the month of Lothron.[8] Sador was among \"a few old men and women\" who Morwen still kept as servants, and therefore was not one of the thralls Brodda forced to build his his wooden hall. Sador did not fight in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, though he wished that he did and was dismayed that he could not do so, and \"die a valiant death\"[citation needed].[9] When Morwen first told T\u00farin that he was to go to Doriath, he hoped that Sador could go with him, only for Morwen to say he wouldn\u2019t because it would be \"a hard road\" for him. The next morning, T\u00farin found Sador preparing to use the unfinished great chair of H\u00farin as firewood and tried to convince him that H\u00farin would return and be pleased with the chair. However, Sador explained that \"false hopes\" would not keep them warm in the coming winter. He nonetheless added that the true purpose of the chair was the joy of making it. Sador then talked with him about the necessity of his departure. T\u00farin was sad but understood. Sador also urged him to take back the Elven knife. T\u00farin refused, saying that he would get many things like it in Doriath.[10]\nSador stayed in the house of Morwen for a long while, but soon after Morwen and Ni\u00ebnor left to go to Doriath, he became a vagabond to avoid being enslaved by the Easterlings like the rest of the Men of Dor-l\u00f3min. Nonetheless, he was often given broth and a place by the fire in Brodda's hall because Aerin somehow forced Brodda to keep \"some of the kindlier manners of old\". Sador was among the vagabonds and servants who believed that T\u00farin had become \"a king or a lord in some south country\" and had summoned Morwen and Ni\u00ebnor from Dor-l\u00f3min.[9]\nIn the year 496 during the Fell Winter,[11] Sador was resting by the fire in Brodda's hall when a grief-stricken vagabond came to the hall and \"was given a seat by the fire\" and some broth before asking for news of Morwen, shocking Sador and the others by speaking \"the old tongue\". Sador warned him to speak quieter, deducing that he was of the House of Hador. He then revealed all he knew about Morwen, revealed his name, and reminisced on the years before the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad. Upon learning that the other man was T\u00farin, Sador took him outside the hall and learned that he did not summon Morwen and Ni\u00ebnor. After Sador told him that Aerin might know of Morwen's whereabouts, T\u00farin re-entered the hall and received answers from Aerin. However, after realizing Glaurung's trickery in sending him there, he killed Brodda and three weaponless Easterlings, instigating a rebellion in the hall. Sador partook in this uprising, but was fatally wounded in the \"great fighting\" that followed. He was, however, able to say his final words to T\u00farin before perishing, warning him to flee before the Easterlings return with reinforcements.[9]",

Sam talked about strange things that had been happening in the Shire, including a Tree-man that his cousin Halfast Gamgee claimed to have seen walking on the North Moors. Ted Sandyman scoffed at Sam's tales, calling them children's stories. Neither was Ted interested in the news that the Elves were leaving Middle-earth. He questioned the reliability of Sam's sources of information - Bilbo and Frodo Baggins - saying: \"Oh, they're both cracked. Leastways old Bilbo was cracked, and Frodo's cracking.\"[1]\nWhen Sam looked at the Mirror of Galadriel, he saw a vision of Ted cutting down trees at the avenue beyond the mill, that shades the road to Bywater. Sam was enraged, wishing he could get at Ted. Sam suspected that there was some devilry at work in\u00a0the Shire, and exclaimed that he had to go home, but Galadriel said he could not go home alone, and should not blindly trust what he saw in the mirror. Sam reluctantly accepted that, but said \"If what I've seen turn out\u00a0true, somebody's going to catch it hot!\". The vision Sam saw indeed came true, as revealed in \"Scouring of the Shire\".[2]\nAfter Frodo and Sam left the Shire in September of 3018, Lotho Sackville-Baggins bought the Old Mill and tore it down. He replaced it with an ugly brick building that straddled the river and was full of wheels and strange contraptions to increase production. The next year in September of 3019, Saruman took over operation of the Mill and it was used for some industrial purpose that created noise and pollution.\nTed Sandyman was pleased by these developments and he continued to work in the New Mill. He took orders from the Chief's Men and he participated in the wanton destruction of the Shire by cutting down the trees beyond the Mill that shaded the road to Bywater.\nAfter the Battle of Bywater on November 3, 3019, Frodo and Sam returned to Hobbiton with Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took. They encountered Ted Sandyman at the New Mill. Ted laughed at their dismay at the destruction that had been done to Hobbiton, and he said that if they touched him he would report them to the Chief. When Merry told him that the Chief's Men had been defeated and that the Chief was about to be removed, Ted was shocked. He sounded a horn to raise the alarm, but Merry responded by sounding the Horn of the Mark, and Hobbits from all over Hobbiton responded.[3]\nHis fate afterwards is unknown.",

The king demanded to know why his ancestors E\u00e4rendil and Tuor lived in Valinor and had eternal life yet he did not. The ambassadors answered that theirs was a fate apart and that the Undying Lands did not themselves make their inhabitants immortal, but were named for those that dwelled in them.

Tar-Meneldur encouraged the seafarers, and allowed his son Aldarion to establish the Guild of Venturers, which became one of the most powerful organisations in N\u00famenor. Many voyages along the coasts were made at this time, and the first settlements were made in Middle-earth by N\u00famen\u00f3rean explorers, although none of them permanent yet. These early settlements were however the later cores of Arnor and Gondor, and the re-established contact of N\u00famen\u00f3reans with their distant kin allowed the Ad\u00fbnaic tongue to merge with local, far akin languages, eventually leading to the Westron speech. This would in later years prove to be one of the greatest assets to the power of N\u00famenor in Middle-earth.\nNear the end of Tar-Meneldur's rule reports came that evil had begun to stir in the east of Middle-earth (the first awakenings of Sauron, as was later learned), and Gil-galad requested the aid of Tar-Meneldur. Recognizing his son Aldarion was more aware of the troubles, and was a powerful leader of men, Meneldur abdicated in favour of his son far earlier than was expected.\nOn the family front Meneldur, together with his wife Almarian, attempted to mediate between his son Aldarion and Aldarion's betrothed Erendis, who had become estranged. For a time they were successful, and Aldarion and Erendis were wed, but Aldarion soon left again for sea. It was during his long absence in Middle-earth, a time during which Aldarion was instructed by Gil-galad, that Erendis left the royal court for her home. By the time Aldarion returned even Meneldur's best attempts could not heal the breach.\nMeneldur was a lover of star-lore and enjoyed watching their motions.

Early in his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet \"Oakenshield,\" which remained with him even in death.[2]\nThorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850, after his father went missing and died in the dungeons of Dol Guldur.\nQuest for the Lonely Mountain\nIn TA 2941, Gandalf the Grey found Thorin in The Prancing Pony at Bree and set in motion a scheme to retake the mountain. He gave Thorin a map and key that he had received from Thr\u00e1in in Dol Guldur before he died. Thorin then took a contingent of twelve Dwarves to visit Bilbo Baggins in order to hire him as a burglar for their mission. Thorin intended to infiltrate the Lonely Mountain and retake the treasure from Smaug.[3]\nThorin Oakenshield, by TolmanCotton of DeviantArt\nThe Dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf encountered many dangers on their journey to the Lonely Mountain, surviving Trolls, Orcs, Wargs, and Spiders. He found the legendary sword Orcrist in a troll-hoard, along with Glamdring.[4] In Rivendell, the Company rested and Elrond translated the Moon-letters on Thr\u00f3r's Map.[5] During their journey through Mirkwood, Thorin and his Company encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil.[6] They escaped in barrels and traveled down to Lake-town.[7]\nThorin and Company were greeted warmly by the people of Lake-town and hailed as the return of the King under the Mountain.[8] They soon reached the Lonely Mountain and the Dwarves sent Bilbo inside, who conversed with a newly awakened Smaug.[9] Realizing that the Lake-men must have helped the intruders, an enraged Smaug flew towards Lake-town to take revenge. There he was killed by Bard the Bowman, who pierced the bare spot on Smaug's left breast with his black arrow.[10]\nFollowing the death of Smaug, the people of Lake-town asked Thorin for a share of the treasure, as they wanted recompense for the destruction of their home, a part of Smaug's treasure originating from their former city, and because a man of Lake-town who shot the fatal arrow that killed Smaug. Thorin, overwhelmed by greed after recovering his family's riches, and enraged by the presence of Thranduil, refused to share any part of the treasure.[11] Instead, he sent a Raven to seek aid from his relative, D\u00e1in Ironfoot, who sent a force of Dwarven soldiers on the move to secure the reclaimed mountain city.[12] Meanwhile, Thorin charged his companions with looking for the Arkenstone within the hoard of treasure, and gifted Bilbo a mithril shirt for his bravery. However, Bilbo had already found the Arkenstone, and subsequently, brought it to Bard and Thranduil in secret to use as a bargaining counter.[12] When Thorin learned of this, he became enraged and denounced his former companion as a traitor.[13]\nThorin on his deathbed, with Bilbo and Gandalf, by Darrell Sweet\nThe growing conflict over the treasure between Dwarves, Elves, and Men, likely to result in bloodshed, was suddenly averted by the approach of goblin and warg armies, so they instead joined forces to defeat their common enemies in what was later called the Battle of Five Armies. During the battle, Thorin led an assault that proved his strength as a leader, striking out from the mountain and providing vital aid as the goblins threatened to overwhelm his allies. He fought courageously, but was mortally wounded in the battle, requiring Beorn to take him to safety.[13]\nBefore he died, he made his peace with Bilbo by commending the Hobbit's bravery and good character, apologising for his harsh words as he now recognised his comrade's fundamentally benevolent motives. His last words were, \"If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. But, sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell.\"[14]",

Thorin then became King under the Mountain.\nWhen the news of Sauron's defeat in the South came to the ears of the enemy, they became dismayed and the Dwarves and Men came forth from the mountain and routed them, driving them back to the river Redwater, never troubling them again.[1]\nWith his father's death, Thorin became king in TA 3019. Thorin III helped rebuild the Lonely Mountain and Dale, and prospered. His realm became a close ally of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor of King Elessar.\nDuring his rule, Gimli, son of Gl\u00f3in, led a number of Dwarves south to the Glittering Caves, where a new city was settled.\nThorin III had a descendant, who was held to be the reincarnation of Durin the Deathless and who, at the death of his unnamed father, succeeded him as Durin VII the Last.[1]\nThorin III Stonehelm (Trading Card image)",

        "biography": "First and Second Ages[]\nThranduil was the only son of Oropher, King of the Woodland Realm. He was born during the First Age, and lived in Doriath at some point prior to the Second Kinslaying.[2]\u00a0At the beginning of the Second Age, some Sindar traveled east and Oropher eventually founded the Elven realm in Greenwood the Great.\nIn SA 3434, Thranduil and his father fought in the Battle of Dagorlad. Oropher was slain and Thranduil returned to Greenwood with roughly a third of the army that had marched to war.[2] He claimed his inheritance and became King of the Woodland Realm, reigning over the whole of Greenwood the Great.\nThird Age[]\nThe Elvenking, by Ulla Thynell\nAs the Third Age progressed, however, a sorcerer known as the Necromancer (later revealed to be Sauron returned) took over the abandoned Elven fortress of Amon Lanc and turned it into Dol Guldur. Under his malign influence the Greenwood grew dark, becoming known as Mirkwood, and infested with Orcs and giant spiders. The Wood-elves of Mirkwood were reduced in number and retreated to lands in the north of Mirkwood. By the time of the events of The Lord of the Rings, Thranduil's title was King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood.[3]\nIn his realm, both Sindarin and Silvan Elvish were spoken,[4] though not all members of his Woodland folk spoke Sindarin.[2]\nThe Quest of Erebor[]\nWhen Thorin II and company entered northern Mirkwood, the party encountered visions of a feast in the woods, which unknown to them was Thranduil's court.[1] Different members of the party tried to enter the clearing where the feast was being held, but each time darkness would fall and the interrupter fell into a deep sleep. In this manner was Thorin separated from the company, and captured by Thranduil. He provided no information when interrogated, and Thranduil, in turn, sent him to his dungeon \"not too gently, for they did not love Dwarves and thought he was an enemy\".[1] The rest of the party was captured shortly after and brought before Thranduil. When the party proved uncooperative with Thranduil's questioning, he accused them of wandering in his kingdom without leave, interrupting their feast, and stirring up trouble with spiders. They were sent to the dungeon as well, in separate cells and unaware that Thorin was captured.[5]\nThranduil: \"What were you doing in the forest?\"Thorin: \"Looking for food and drink, because we were starving.\"Thranduil: \"Take him away and keep him safe, until he feels inclined to tell the truth, even if he waits a hundred years.\"\n\u2014The Hobbit, \"Flies and Spiders\"\n\nBilbo shows the Arkenstone to the Elvenking and Bard, by Ted Nasmith\nAfter the death of the dragon Smaug, Thranduil supported Bard the Bowman's claim of a share of the treasure the Dwarves recovered from the Lonely Mountain, since Bard was a descendant of Lord Girion of Dale, and the treasure of that town had been taken by Smaug to the Lonely Mountain.[6]\nThranduil led the Elven forces in the Battle of Five Armies. His army was positioned on the southern side of the Mountain, and was the first to charge.[7]\nAfter the battle and Thorin's death, Thranduil took\u00a0Orcrist, which was previously confiscated in Mirkwood, and laid it upon Thorin's tomb. The treasure was divided among Elves and Men, and Thranduil received the emeralds in the necklace of Girion, which he most desired. Bilbo, Gandalf and Beorn traveled with the Elf-host back to Mirkwood but would not stay in the woods, even when Thranduil asked them to.[8]\nWhen Bilbo and Gandalf bade farewell, Bilbo gave Thranduil a necklace of silver and pearls. The king gave Bilbo the title of \"elf-friend\" and returned with his host to their halls.[8]\nWar of the Ring[]\nDuring the War of the Ring, he sent his son Legolas to Rivendell, along with other Elves, to report Gollum's escape from Mirkwood.[3] The gradually-established friendship between the Dwarf Gimli and Legolas later helped to reconcile Thranduil's people with the Dwarves.\nWhen the forces from Dol Guldur later attacked Mirkwood, Thranduil repulsed the attack and had the victory. He came into an agreement with Celeborn that the southern part of Mirkwood would be counted as East L\u00f3rien. Thranduil took the northern region as far as the Mountains of Mirkwood; the wide forest between Mirkwood and East L\u00f3rien was given to the Beornings and the Woodmen of Western Mirkwood. At this time also, Thranduil renamed Mirkwood Eryn Lasgalen, the Wood of Greenleaves.[9]\nFourth Age[]\nAfter the fall of Sauron, Thranduil fixed the southern boundary of his realm as the Mountains of Mirkwood, and his realm flourished well into the Fourth Age.[9] He may have stayed on as the king of the Great Forest or left Middle-earth and departed to the Undying Lands.",

He married sometime before TA 2746 and had three children: Thorin, Frerin, and D\u00eds.\nLife in exile[]\nThr\u00e1in fled Erebor with his father, his three children, and the surviving Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain when the dragon Smaug descended on the mountain in TA 2770, desolating the kingdom and claiming its treasure. Exiled, he and his relatives wandered farther south, and they eventually settled in the hills of Dunland. They would remain in Dunland for twenty years, reduced to poverty.\nYears after the destruction of Erebor, poverty took a toll on the mind of King Thr\u00f3r, rendering him restless and desperate. He sought to journey away searching for a scrap of wealth, though he did not specify Moria. At their parting, he gave to his son Thr\u00e1in his Ring of power and the Map and Key to the Side-door of the Lonely Mountain. He departed from his people with a single companion, his only and old friend named N\u00e1r.\nWar of the Dwarves and Orcs[]\n\nN\u00e1r would return to their dwelling in Dunland many weeks later, but he would return alone. He told the tale to Thr\u00e1in of what had become of his father Thr\u00f3r, who had brashly ventured into Moria, despite the pleas of N\u00e1r not to go in, but he did not return. Days later, it was revealed that the King had been branded and murdered by Azog the Orc, who claimed to now rule the ancient mansions of Durin's Folk.\nWhen Thr\u00e1in heard N\u00e1r's recounting of what had become of his father and that an Orc was ruling their ancestral home, he wept and tore his beard and then fell silent. For seven days, he sat and said no word. However, on the seventh day, he stood up and declared, \"This cannot be borne!\" These words were the beginning of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.\n\nThr\u00e1in sent messengers to deliver the tale to all the corners of the world. Word was sent to all the Houses of the other Dwarven Fathers. The kings of the other Houses answered to Thr\u00e1in's call to vengeance, as they all saw this heinous deed committed by Azog to be a profound dishonor to the heir of the eldest of their race, and it raised their fury. While most of the war was fought in the mines and tunnels beneath the Misty Mountains, the climactic Battle of Azanulbizar took place beneath the East-gate of Moria in the valley of Azanulbizar. Heavy losses were inflicted on both sides. Frerin, the younger brother of Thorin Oakenshield, was among those that fell. Thr\u00e1in himself had been wounded in the battle and suffered a grievous eye-wound. The tide of war, at last, turned when fresh reinforcements from the Iron Hills arrived late. Realizing that his hordes were being annihilated and routed by the Dwarves, Azog turned and attempted to flee back to the gate but was slain by D\u00e1in Ironfoot, bringing about an end to the war.\nLater life and capture[]\nAfterward, Thr\u00e1in led the remainder of his people \u2013 among them his eldest son Thorin Oakenshield\u00a0\u2013 back to Dunland, where they dwelt for a while. Eventually, they relocated to the northern Blue Mountains, where they made their dwelling. After some time, they showed signs of prosperity, and their numbers slowly began to increase.\nMany years later, Thr\u00e1in grew older, and he became restless, fed by the Ring of Power in his possession.[1] His desire to reclaim his kingdom of the Lonely Mountain grew. In TA 2841, he and a group of followers, including Balin and Dwalin, left their dwelling in the Blue Mountains and journeyed into Wilderland. The servants of Sauron pursued them, and one morning in TA 2845, in the eaves of Mirkwood, his companions awoke to find that Thr\u00e1in was missing. They searched in vain for him for days, but he could not be found at all. It was later learned that he had been captured and imprisoned in the pits of Sauron's stronghold of Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood. There he was tortured, and Sauron took from him the last of the Dwarven Rings of Power and left him there to die.[1][2]\nThr\u00f3r's Map\nDepiction of Thr\u00f3r's Key in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film trilogy\nBefore Thr\u00e1in's death \u2013 while on a mission to Dol Guldur \u2013 Gandalf the Grey came upon Thr\u00e1in and was given the map and key made by his father, Thr\u00f3r. Thr\u00e1in appeared so diminished that he had forgotten almost everything, including his name. Gandalf promised to deliver it to Thorin but could not confirm that this Dwarf was, in fact, Thr\u00e1in due to Thr\u00e1in's loss of memory. There he died.[3]\nLegacy[]\nYears later, Gandalf met with Thorin near the village of Bree. There, Gandalf promised to help Thorin on his quest to reclaim Erebor. The most notable way Gandalf helped was when he invited the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins on the journey to act as the company's burglar.\nSeveral decades later, during the Council of Elrond, Gl\u00f3in revealed that part of Balin's motivation for attempting to re-enter Moria was to find the last Dwarven Ring of Power, which was last seen in Thr\u00f3r's possession. Gandalf regretfully informed them that Thr\u00f3r had passed the ring to Thr\u00e1in, and when Thr\u00e1in was captured in Dol Guldur, the ring was stripped from his possession. Gl\u00f3in mourned this loss, wondering aloud when, if ever, the Dwarves would have their vengeance against the Dark Lord Sauron.",

In TA 2589, when their halls came under attack by Cold-drakes, his father D\u00e1in I and younger brother Fr\u00f3r were both slain at their gates by a great Cold-drake, and Thr\u00f3r inherited the kingship. He and his youngest brother Gr\u00f3r resolved to divide their folk: Thr\u00f3r led a small portion of Durin's Folk to recolonize Erebor, taking the Arkenstone with him. Gr\u00f3r led the other portion of Durin's Folk further east to the Iron Hills where he founded his realm.[1]\nThr\u00f3r sitting on his throne with the Arkenstone\nUnder Thr\u00f3r's leadership, Erebor prospered for over a century. Eventually, the wealth of the kingdom attracted the attention of the dragon Smaug, who flew south and assaulted and destroyed the kingdom, killing hundreds of Dwarves and driving away Thr\u00f3r and his family, as well as thousands of other survivors. The majority of the survivors migrated to the Iron Hills, but some followed King Thr\u00f3r, his son Thr\u00e1in II, and grandson Thorin Oakenshield westward into a long, homeless wandering. They eventually settled in the hills of Dunland, and made a sufficient living there.[1]\nTwenty years later in TA 2790, Thr\u00f3r now old, poor, and desperate, gave to his son Thr\u00e1in II the last of the Seven Rings, a key and map of the Lonely Mountain. He then left his people and journeyed away north with a single companion called N\u00e1r. They crossed over the Misty Mountains through the Redhorn Pass and then came south again, crossing the Silverlode into the valley of Azanulbizar beneath the East-gate of Moria. When they arrived, the gate was open. N\u00e1r begged Thr\u00f3r to beware but, Thr\u00f3r disregarded his pleas and proudly entered Moria as its returning heir, but he did not come back.[1]\nN\u00e1r waited and hid nearby for many days. One day he heard a great shout, followed by the blast of a horn, and a body was flung out onto the steps. It was indeed the body of Thr\u00f3r, as N\u00e1r had feared. Then a voice called out to him from just inside the gate. Rather than being killed as well, N\u00e1r was instead made use of as a messenger. He was told to deliver a warning that 'beggars' who would not wait at the doors but instead entered to attempt thieving, would meet a similar fate. N\u00e1r was told to bring this message back to his people. But that was not all: the voice proclaimed that he now ruled Moria, and if any wanted to know who was king, he had written his name on the beggar's face. Thr\u00f3r's head lay severed next to his body. N\u00e1r turned it over and found branded across the forehead, written in Dwarven runes, a name that would be branded in the hearts of all Dwarves: Azog. He was barred from retrieving the head of Thr\u00f3r and was struck with a pouch containing a few coins of little worth, which Azog referred to as a 'fee', but it was meant as a final insulting gesture. N\u00e1r took the pouch and fled down the Silverlode. When he looked back, Orcs had emerged from the gate and were hacking apart Thr\u00f3r's body and flinging the pieces to the black\u00a0crows.[1]\nThis was the tale that N\u00e1r brought back to Thr\u00e1in II when he returned to Dunland weeks later. After seven days of sitting in silent grief, Thr\u00e1in at last stood up and declared that this atrocity would be answered. This was the beginning of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, although it took up\u00a0to three years for the Dwarves to gather their full forces. The war culminated with the Battle of Azanulbizar, which, though costly, was won by the Dwarves, and D\u00e1in Ironfoot, son of N\u00e1in, beheaded Azog and mounted the Orc's head on a stick. The pouch of coins originally flung at N\u00e1r was stuffed into Azog's mouth.[1]\nLegacy[]\nThr\u00f3r's Map\nDepiction of Thr\u00f3r's Key in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film trilogy\nThr\u00f3r's map, which he had made at some point prior to his death, and the Key to the Side-door were eventually passed to his grandson Thorin II by the wizard Gandalf through Thr\u00f3r's son, Thr\u00e1in, during the latter's imprisonment at Dol Guldur. This map was translated by Elrond, and utilized by Thorin's company in the year TA 2941 to reclaim Erebor from Smaug.[2]",

Th\u00e9oden spoke Sindarin and Westron more often than Rohanese, due to the influence of his father, and spent a part of his youth growing up in the mountain vales of Gondor, his mother's homeland.[1]\nHis sister Th\u00e9odwyn lived with him in Edoras, and after she and her husband both died he adopted her children \u00c9omer and \u00c9owyn as his own. He had a son Th\u00e9odred, whose mother, Elfhild, died at childbirth.[1]\nWar of the Ring[]\nBy the time of the War of the Ring, Th\u00e9oden had been king for nearly 40 years, and was becoming old and tired. He was increasingly misled by his chief adviser Gr\u00edma (or Wormtongue as most others in the Mark called him), who was secretly in the employ of Saruman the White. Gr\u00edma may even have been poisoning Th\u00e9oden. In the last years before the War of the Ring, Th\u00e9oden let his rule slip out of his hands, and Gr\u00edma gained an increasingly large hold over him. Rohan had been troubled by Orcs and Dunlendings since the time of his father and now by the new fighting Uruk-hai, who operated under the will of Saruman, ruling from Isengard.[3]\nGrima with Th\u00e9oden, under a spell, in the Golden Hall of Meduseld\nWhen Th\u00e9oden's son Th\u00e9odred was mortally wounded at the First Battle of the Fords of Isen with the Orcs of Saruman, his nephew \u00c9omer became his heir. \u00c9omer however fell out of favor with Wormtongue and was placed under arrest.\nTh\u00e9oden upon reclaiming his sword, Herugrim\nWhen Gandalf the White, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli appeared before him, Th\u00e9oden initially rebuked Gandalf's advice to resist Saruman, but after being released from the effects of Gr\u00edma, he commanded H\u00e1ma to release his nephew and bring him his sword. Th\u00e9oden, under advice from Gandalf, advanced to face the invasion by the forces of Saruman. However on meeting Ceorl on the road and realising the strength of Isengard he rode instead to the fortress of the Hornburg, and shortly thereafter successfully defended the keep at the Battle of the Hornburg despite overwhelming odds. After this, he became known as Th\u00e9oden Ednew, the Renewed, because he had thrown off the yoke of Saruman.\nFollowing the battle, Th\u00e9oden came with Gandalf to the ruins of Isengard, where he met Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took. He soon had favor for Merry, and expressed great interest in hearing more about the Shire, especially Hobbit lore surrounding pipe-weed. Riding to Dunharrow by mountain paths, Th\u00e9oden arrived to find the muster of the Rohirrim in full swing. That night, errand riders from Gondor arrived and presented him with the Red Arrow, a symbol of dire need and summons to fulfill the Oath of Eorl.\nTh\u00e9oden then led six thousand Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, bravely charging the legions of Sauron, where he won great glory by defeating a chieftain of the Southrons along with the bearer of a banner depicting a black serpent.[5]\n\n\"Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a king of old\"\n\u2014Tolkien's description of Th\u00e9oden charging the Orcs\nKing Th\u00e9oden dies\nTh\u00e9oden slaying the Harad leader, by Kip Rasmussen\nHe challenged the Witch-king of the nine Ringwraiths, and was mortally wounded when his horse Snowmane fell upon him after being spooked by the Witch-king's winged steed.

He was the youngest of four children and had three older sisters, Pearl, Pimpernel, and Pervinca. His father's sister, Esmeralda Took, was the mother of Meriadoc Brandybuck, thus making Pippin and Merry first cousins.[4]\nThrough his father, Pippin was the second-cousin once-removed of Frodo Baggins, and the first-cousin twice-removed of Bilbo.[4]\nBilly Boyd portrays Peregrin in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy\nWar of the Ring\nFellowship of the Ring\nWhile on their way to Buckland, Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and Peregrin Took encountered a Black Rider, who was warded off by the presence of a company of Elves, led by Gildor Inglorion.[5] Meriadoc Brandybuck later joined them once they reached Buckland. They were waylaid by Old Man Willow in the Old Forest,[6] and Tom Bombadil rescued them and took them into his house.[7] On the way to Bree, Pippin was caught up with the Barrow-wights on the Barrow-downs. After the encounter, Pippin acquired a Dagger of Westernesse.[8]\nIn The Prancing Pony, Frodo accidentally slipped the One Ring upon his finger, drawing the attention of the Black Riders.[9] Their group met a Ranger of the North, Strider. The inn was attacked by the Nazg\u00fbl at night, and the four hobbits were successfully led away by Strider, whose real name was Aragorn.[10]\nAragorn led them to Weathertop, where the group was once again attacked by the Black Riders.[11] In haste to get an injured Frodo to Rivendell, the Elf-lord Glorfindel arrived and guided them.[12]\nAfter the Council of Elrond, Pippin and Merry were allowed by Elrond to join the Fellowship of the Ring.[13]\nIn Moria, Pippin thoughtlessly dropped a stone down a well, which roused goblins in various caverns and revealed the Fellowship's presence to them. It incurred Gandalf's wrath, and he called Pippin a \"fool of a Took\". The battle of the Chamber of Mazarbul followed.[14]\nPippin and Merry in Fangorn Forest, by Raoul Vitale\nCapture by the Uruk-hai\nIn the Skirmish at Amon Hen, Pippin and Merry were protected by Boromir, who was killed in the process. The two hobbits were taken away by the Uruk-hai, mistaking them to be the Ring-bearer.[15] On their way to Isengard, Pippin dropped the Elven-brooch he received from Lothl\u00f3rien, as a sign for Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, who were in pursuit.\nWhen a company of the Rohirrim ambushed the Uruk-hai,[16] Pippin and Merry were able to escape into Fangorn Forest, where they meet the Ent Treebeard. They both drank Ent-draughts during their time in Fangorn, which increased their heights substantially.[17] Pippin and Merry eventually befriended Treebeard and told him what had happened to them. After the Entmoot, the Ents decided to march against Isengard.[18] Pippin and Merry were reunited with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf after Isengard's destruction.[19]\nGuard of the Citadel\nIn Orthanc, Pippin picked up Saruman's palant\u00edr, which Gr\u00edma Wormtongue threw. As he looked into the stone, Pippin had a first-hand encounter with Sauron himself, leading the Dark Lord to assume Pippin was the Ring-bearer. Gandalf and Pippin then rode on Shadowfax to Gondor, for the latter's protection from Sauron's forces.[20] Pippin met Denethor II, the Ruling Steward of Gondor and Boromir's father. In recompense for Boromir's death, Pippin pledged his allegiance to Denethor and became a Guard of the Citadel.[21]\nPippin wearing the Citadel Guard livery in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\nWhile in Minas Tirith, Pippin befriended Beregond, a fellow Guard of the Citadel, his son Bergil, and Faramir, Boromir's younger brother. During the Siege of Gondor, Pippin witnessed Denethor preparing a pyre in the Hallows for himself and an unconscious Faramir. Pippin quickly went out in search for Gandalf, with whom he was able to save Faramir from being burned to death. Denethor, however, burned to death in the pyre he had made.[22]\nLast days of the war\nPippin was among the army of the West, which was led by Aragorn. They assaulted the Black Gate to divert the attention of Sauron and give Frodo enough time to destroy the Ring. In the Battle of the Black Gate, Pippin managed to kill one of the Olog-hai, a troll-race bred by Sauron, the first hobbit ever to do so. He was knocked unconscious when the troll fell on him. Gimli later recognized the Hobbit feet under the Troll and brought him to the healers, saving his life.[23] After his coronation, King Elessar knighted him and granted him and his fellow hobbits leave to return home, as well as leave to return to Gondor whenever they liked. Later, he, Merry, Frodo, and Sam were instrumental in overthrowing the small remainder of Saruman's forces during the Scouring of the Shire.[24]\nAfter the war\nIn the year FO 6 of the Fourth Age Pippin married Diamond of Long Cleeve, when she was 32 and he himself was 37. They had one son, Faramir Took, who later married Samwise Gamgee's daughter Goldilocks Gardner.[25]\nIn the year FO 13, Pippin became the 32nd Shire-thain, a position he held for fifty years before renouncing it in FO 63, when he revisited Rohan and Gondor with Merry. He remained in Gondor for the rest of his life.[25]\nPippin died some time after the year FO 63 and was laid to rest with Merry in Gondor. After the great King Elessar died in FO 120, Merry and Pippin were entombed next to him.",

        "biography": "Early life[]\nTuor was born in FA 472 after the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad,\u00a0in which his father Huor died. After hearing that the battle was lost, R\u00edan fell into despair and left Dor-l\u00f3min while still pregnant with Tuor. She would have been lost and died if not for the Sindar Elves of Mithrim who rescued her and took her to their home in the Mountains of Mithrim. Tuor was soon born and first fostered by the Grey-elves. Later, their leader Annael told his mother that Huor had perished in the battle. She soon fell into grief in her early twenties and went to Haudh-en-Ndengin, the Hill of the Slain and seeing the mounds of rotting and despoiled remains, she fell sick and died.\nWhen the Easterlings came to claim their reward for aiding Morgoth in the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad, they occupied Hithlum and captured its people as their slaves. The Sindar moved their camp into the caves of Androth and it was there that Tuor spent his youth. In his sixteenth year, he grew angry with the Easterlings and their allies for the evil deeds they had done to his people and wished to fight them. Annael forbid this and Tuor obeyed. When the Elven group intended to move to the safer havens in the Mouths of Sirion through the Gate of the \u00d1oldor, Tuor went with them but the group came under attack by Orcs and scattered during the night. Tuor was captured and sent to the Easterlings and sold into slavery.\nA thrall in Hithlum[]\nTuor served the Easterling chief, the brutal Lorgan, who had been sent there by Morgoth and who cruelly oppressed the remnant of the House of Hador. He worked as a thrall for three years, at which point he had grown to his full stature, and became taller and swifter than any of the Easterlings.\nTuor meeting the Vala Ulmo - by David Greset\nUlmo speaks with Tuor - by John Howe\nWanderings[]\nTuor then escaped, and lived the life of an outlaw. He travelled through Hithlum to the Cirith Ninniach, and then to the Annon-in-Gelydh. At the Gate of the \u00d1oldor, he met two \u00d1oldorin Elves, Gelmir and Arminas, who showed him the way into Nevrast. He spent the rest of the year in Nevrast, until he saw seven swans, and took it as a sign that he had tarried too long. He followed these swans down the coast until he reached the ruins of Vinyamar, the previous home of Turgon and his people. There he found a set of armour left behind by Turgon and putting these on, made his way down to the sea where a great storm was raging.\nAt this point, the Vala Ulmo, Lord of Waters, emerged from the Belegaer and appeared to Tuor, bestowing upon him a great cloak to shield him from the eyes of his enemies, and a quest to remind Turgon of the Doom of the \u00d1oldor, and to warn him of the Fall of Gondolin. He also found Voronw\u00eb, an Elf of Gondolin, who had been a mariner on the last attempted \u00d1oldorin voyage to Valinor, saved from the wrath of Oss\u00eb by Ulmo for the purpose of guiding him to Gondolin.\nTuor and Voronw\u00eb then travelled through the Fell Winter past the Pools of Ivrin, where they caught a glimpse of Tuor's cousin, T\u00farin, wielding Gurthang, and making his way towards the wastes of Dor-l\u00f3min.\nTuor when armed, by L\u012bga K\u013cavi\u0146a\nLife in Gondolin[]\nTuor's coming to Gondolin, by Ted Nasmith\nPassing through the Fell Winter, Tuor and Voronw\u00eb eventually arrived in Gondolin in FA 496. Upon arriving, he proclaimed to have been sent from Ulmo with a message to Turgon. Seeing Tuor arrayed in the devices of Ulmo, he was immediately taken to see the king, where he delivered Ulmo's warning to depart; that Morgoth was coming ever closer to discovering the location of Gondolin. However, Maeglin argued against Tuor and Turgon became conflicted. For he had grown to greatly love his city, which was by now as fair as Tirion itself, and he trusted still in it's secrecy and strength. As such, he did not evacuate as Ulmo advised. However, he did not wholly disregard the wisdom of Ulmo, and decreed that none should ever pass out of the Hidden City again. He ordered the passage through the Encircling Mountains to be sealed up, and as such Tuor was forced to remain in Gondolin, though he did so gladly. Tuor rose quickly in honor in the city, being of great stature both physically and spiritually and having had the privilege of conversing directly with Ulmo. Seven years after arriving in Gondolin, Tuor fell in love with King Turgon's Elven daughter, Idril Celebrindal, who loved him in return. Turgon, who already considered Tuor as close as kin, gave the couple his blessing. They were wed in a celebration of great happiness, and soon after, their only child E\u00e4rendil the Mariner was born, who himself became the father of Elrond and Elros.\nAs told in The Book of Lost Tales Part Two, the Elves in Gondolin treated Tuor very highly: \"Upon a time the king caused his most cunning artificers to fashion a suit of armour for Tuor as a great gift, and it was made of \u00d1oldorin steel overlaid with silver, but his helm was adorned with a device of metal and jewels like two swan-wings, one on either side, and a swan's wing was wrought on his shield\". \"A house was built for him upon the southern walls, for he loved the free airs and liked not the close neighborhood of other dwellings. There it was his delight often to stand on the battlements at dawn, and folk rejoiced to see the new light catch the wings of his helm.\"[1]\nTuor with the other Lords of Gondolin, by Kazuki Mendou\nTuor was one of the leaders of Gondolin in the Fall of Gondolin, and defended the city against the attack by the forces of Morgoth. He achieved meritorious deeds including forcing a fire-drake to retreat. He also stopped an attack on his wife and son by Maeglin, who he was able to thwart by throwing him from the walls, mirroring the fate of his father E\u00f6l. Afterwards he, his wife, their son E\u00e4rendil, and a remnant of Gondolin's people escaped through a\u00a0secret way in the mountains and traveled to the Mouths of Sirion. Longing for the sea, Tuor eventually built the ship E\u00e4rr\u00e1m\u00eb and sailed into the West with Idril.\nDespite his human state of mortality, the tradition of the \u00d1oldor was that when Tuor arrived with Idril in Valinor he became the only Man to be accepted as one of the elder kindred, and thus shared with Beren and L\u00fathien, who were also granted a second life in Middle-earth, the exceptional fate of an immortal life in Valinor as long as Arda endured. Whether E\u00e4rendil ever found or saw his parents again is not known.[2][3]\nIn expanded account of him in The Book of Lost Tales, he and Idril reach the Tower of Pearl on one of the Enchanted Isles in the Shadowy Seas and either one or both fell asleep there for an unknown period of time.",

His wife Elenw\u00eb was lost crossing the Helcarax\u00eb,[2] but Turgon and his daughter Idril came to Nevrast, where he built Vinyamar and gathered to him one-third of the \u00d1oldor of Fingolfin and a large number of Sindar.[3]\nIn the year 50 of the First Age, Turgon was instructed by Ulmo to prepare a secret kingdom and was shown the hidden Vale of Tumladen in the Encircling Mountains. After 52 years of secret labor, Turgon led his people into Gondolin, where he ruled for over 500 years, largely ignoring the events of the Wars of Beleriand.[4][5]\nAbout two hundred years after Gondolin was wrought, Turgon's sister Aredhel journeyed to meet with the Sons of F\u00ebanor. She was lost, however, and returned with her son Maeglin a few years later. After the deaths of both E\u00f6l and Aredhel, Turgon took Maeglin under his wing and made him the Lord of the House of the Mole. Maeglin secretly loved Turgon's daughter Idril, who rejected his advances.[6]\nAside from the misadventure of E\u00f6l, the splendor of Turgon's reign in Gondolin was undisturbed until the Dagor Bragollach, when Turgon was brought his father's body by Thorondor. Two years later Thorondor brought him H\u00farin and Huor, whom he fostered for a year and then allowed to return to Dor-l\u00f3min. At this time, Turgon foresaw the doom of the \u00d1oldor, and he secretly sent mariners to try to obtain the mercy of the Valar.[7] None of these missions was successful and only one of the mariners, Voronw\u00eb, survived the Shadowy Seas paving the way for Tuor's coming to Gondolin.[8]\nTurgon's citadel in Gondolin, by Nicolas Chacin\nTurgon joined the Union of Maedhros with an army ten thousand strong and fought alongside his brother Fingon in the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad, but the sacrifice of H\u00farin, Huor, and the Third House of the Edain enabled him to retreat without revealing the location of Gondolin.[9] When Tuor came to Gondolin in FA 496, Turgon welcomed him, but in his pride, he refused to follow the advice of Ulmo to flee to the Havens of Sirion. The full malice of Morgoth was now directed toward Turgon, the last of the House of Finw\u00eb to control a realm in Middle-earth. At last, aided by the treachery of Maeglin, Morgoth discovered the location of Gondolin, and Turgon was slain defending the city.[10]\n",

        "biography": "A young T\u00farin, while still in Hithlum, by Sara Maria Morello\nEarly life[]\nT\u00farin was the only son of H\u00farin Thalion, Lord of Dor-l\u00f3min, and Morwen Eledhwen. He had a younger sister Urwen, whom everyone called \"Lalaith\" because of her laughter. Urwen was loved more than T\u00farin, who did not speak often and seemed older than his years. However, she died in childhood of a plague and Morwen forbade T\u00farin from speaking Urwen's nickname. T\u00farin became a close friend of Sador the one-legged carpenter, whom he named Labadal (\"hop-a-foot\"). On the morning of T\u00farin's eighth birthday, his father gave him an Elf-wrought knife, but he gave it to Sador. After H\u00farin was captured in the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad, T\u00farin remained with his mother Morwen, who hid him from the Easterlings that Morgoth had sent to Hithlum, fearing they would kill T\u00farin or enslave him. Unknown to T\u00farin at that time, Morgoth had placed a curse on all of H\u00farin's family.\nT\u00farin in Doriath, by Marya Filatova\n\nTime in Doriath[]\nWhen T\u00farin was eight years old, Morwen decided to send him to the Elven realm of Doriath. Before his departure, Sador offered him to give him his blade back, but he refused. After travelling to Doriath with Gethron and Grithnir, he was found by Beleg, who gave food to him, and was adopted by Thingol as a son after meeting the Elf-maiden Nellas in the woods. After this, T\u00farin's second sister Ni\u00ebnor was born. T\u00farin was restless, and as soon as he was permitted he joined Beleg C\u00fathalion on the marches of Doriath, fighting the Orcs of Morgoth. It was in this time he received the Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min from Thingol. In his early battles his helm protected him from many injuries, as he was inexperienced in warfare. The helm was an heirloom of the House of Hador and because of it the Orcs feared him above all others.\nT\u00farin, by Alan Lee, wearing the Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min, as seen on the cover of The Children of H\u00farin (2007)\nLife as an outlaw[]\nT\u00farin accidentally caused the death of Saeros, one of Thingol's counsellors who provoked and attacked him. Before he could be either punished or forgiven for it, he fled, eventually encountering a band of outlaws that dwelt south of Brethil. With them, he identified himself only as Neithan (\"the wronged\"). The men of the band realized he was by far more skilled than themselves, so they accepted him. T\u00farin slew their leader after seeing him terrorize a woman, and became the outlaws' leader in his place. As leader, he stopped the band from raiding houses of free folk, and directed them to only assail Orcs.\nIn the meantime, Beleg C\u00fathalion obtained leave from Thingol to seek out his friend. In FA 487, Beleg found T\u00farin's outlaws at the outskirts of Amon R\u00fbdh and was held and tied up by them until T\u00farin returned. Andr\u00f3g, who was a prominent member of the group, mistrusted Beleg even after T\u00farin declared him a friend and begrudged him T\u00farin`s friendship. Beleg tried to persuade T\u00farin to return to Doriath, for the king held that he was innocent. When Beleg could not persuade his friend to leave the outlaws, he left to return to Doriath. T\u00farin's band later captured M\u00eem the Petty-dwarf while Beleg and T\u00farin were parted. M\u00eem was forced to share his halls on Amon R\u00fbdh with his company while T\u00farin promised to repay M\u00eem for the accidental death of his son Kh\u00eem.\nDeath of Beleg[]\nAt Doriath, Beleg asked to be able to join his friend. Thingol allowed this and also gave him the sword Anglachel, and Thingol's wife Melian gave him Lembas. Beleg returned to T\u00farin that winter, healing those of the band that had become sick with cold. Beleg brought with him the Dragon-helm, after T\u00farin agreed to take the Dragon-helm, the area around Amon R\u00fbdh became known as Dor-C\u00faarthol, \"The Land of Bow and Helm\" (since Beleg was known as a mighty bowman). There T\u00farin took the name Gorthol, \"The Dread Helm\". Many warriors joined them, and much of the west of Beleriand was freed from evil for a while. M\u00eem, however, was greatly jealous of Beleg's friendship with T\u00farin.\nThe death of Beleg, by Elena Kukanova\nEventually, T\u00farin was betrayed by M\u00eem the dwarf. He allowed a pack of Orcs to have information with which they could destroy the company, as long as he was allowed to kill Beleg himself. T\u00farin was captured at the top of Amon R\u00fbdh and all his men were slain about him. Beleg was saved by Androg who drove M\u00edm away and then cut Beleg's bonds with his last action before dying. Beleg then rescued T\u00farin from the Orcs in Taur-nu-Fuin with the help of Gwindor, an escaped slave of Morgoth, but T\u00farin accidentally killed Beleg with the sword Anglachel, for Beleg, who was trying to cut T\u00farin's bonds, was mistaken by T\u00farin as one of the Orcs tormenting him. Gwindor and T\u00farin then fled the others, and as T\u00farin's mind was lost in a silent sadness, Gwindor led him to the Pools of Ivrin, where T\u00farin then cried and his madness was cured.\n\nLeader of Nargothrond[]\nGwindor then led T\u00farin to Nargothrond, where once he had lived. In Nargothrond, T\u00farin hid his name, calling himself by the alias Agarwaen son of \u00damarth (Sindarin for \"Bloodstained son of Ill-fate\"), while hoping to hide his identity and escape Morgoth's curse upon his kin. He had Anglachel re-forged and named it Gurthang, \"Iron of Death\". Finduilas, daughter of Orodreth, fell in love with him, but he avoided her because she had previously been the beloved of his friend Gwindor. T\u00farin declined to tell her his name, so that she called him Thurin (the secret). He was also called Adanedhel (Man-Elf) because he was so like an elf, though he was human. Gwindor later revealed T\u00farin's true identity to Finduilas when anger and sadness over took him and it eventually reached Finduilas' father, King Orodreth.\nThe revelation of his identity resulted in T\u00farin becoming a chief counsellor of Orodreth, and was extremely influential in Nargothrond. He encouraged the Nargothrondrim to abandon their practice of secrecy, and they built a great bridge before the gates. Because of his prowess with Gurthang, he himself became known as the Mormegil (Black Sword), or the Black Sword of Nargothrond. In FA 495, with Orodreth now deep in the council of T\u00farin, the Elves of Nargothrond marched out from their secret city with an army of some thousands of Elves to confront the enemy massing beneath the Ered Wethrin (Mountains of Shadow) and in the Pass of Sirion. They were overwhelmed and driven into the Plain of Tumhalad and utterly defeated in the Battle of Tumhalad. Only T\u00farin, who wore the Dragon Helm of Dor-l\u00f3min was able to survive the hot fiery blasts of Glaurung and escaped. There was a desperate attempt to destroy the bridge T\u00farin has ordered to be built for swifter actions of the army, alas it was too well made and the enemy arrived and Glaurung the father of dragons destroyed the gate and the sacking of the once mighty Nargothrond, began.\nThe dragon's deceit[]\nT\u00farin and N\u00edniel in Brethil, by Gustavo Malek\nT\u00farin was caught by the powerful gaze of Glaurung at the smashed gate of the city, and stood by idly as Finduilas and hundreds of captives were dragged away. Finduilas called to him, but her cries were drowned out by the distance. T\u00farin was released from Glaurung's spell, which deceived T\u00farin into believing Morwen and Ni\u00ebnor were suffering in Dor-l\u00f3min, and T\u00farin abandoned Finduilas to seek them out. In actuality, Morwen and Ni\u00ebnor were safely in Doriath, as T\u00farin's own efforts had made the way passable.\n\"T\u00farin the Silent\", by Jay Johnstone\nOnce in Dor-l\u00f3min, T\u00farin found his old home empty. He went to the halls of the Easterling lord Brodda, who had taken H\u00farin's kinswoman Aerin as a wife and many a time beaten her and enslaved T\u00farin's people, Brodda had also taken H\u00farin's lands and possessions to which also rightfully belonged to T\u00farin. From Aerin, T\u00farin learned that Morwen had left, and in his rage, he held Brodda up like a dog and threw him in a group of men, breaking Brodda\u2019s neck and killing him, thereby also sealing Aerin's fate. As T\u00farin left again, Aerin burnt herself alive in Brodda's halls, and the remainder of the House of Hador now was persecuted even more cruelly. There he also met Sador once again before he died, adding to the list of people whose lives his rash actions had ended.\nT\u00farin next tried to find Finduilas, but when he had picked up the Orcs' trail, woodsmen of Brethil informed him she had been killed as they had tried to rescue the prisoners of Nargothrond. T\u00farin collapsed on the mound she was buried in, and was brought to Brethil.\nIn Brethil, T\u00farin renamed himself Turambar (Master of Doom) in an act of bravado, deciding that his curse was finally over. One night in the middle of a fierce storm he and his men found a naked young woman on Finduilas's grave, and called her N\u00edniel \"Maiden of tears\" due to her crying, for she knew nothing. T\u00farin years later took her as his wife. T\u00farin did not know that this was indeed his sister, whose memory had been erased by Glaurung. Brandir, out of jealousy or forecast, told N\u00edniel that a shadow was cast above T\u00farin, and that instead of being Master of Shadow, the Shadow would inevitably master him.\n\nSlayer of Glaurung[]\nGlaurung's death, by John Howe\nT\u00farin's happiness ended when Glaurung came near Brethil, burning miles and miles of forest so that he could reach where the woodsmen lived. T\u00farin with two others set out to kill the dragon, but he was the only one to reach the drake. Darlas, being too cowardly, abandoned T\u00farin, but Hunthor the faithful went on. As T\u00farin passed underneath the dragon, he nearly toppled into the waters due to the dragon's stench had it not been for Hunthor, who steadied him. Unfortunately, as a result of this action, a stone moved by Glaurang's passing hit Hunthor on the head, and he fell into the ravine. With his black sword and bitterness in his heart, T\u00farin then stabbed the dragon's belly with all his hatred and power; killing Glaurung at Cabed-en-Aras, but as he retrieved his sword the foul blood of the Dragon fell on his hand and he was hurt and fell in a swoon. As N\u00edniel came to search for him, Glaurung with his last words revealed to her that she was Turin's sister. Horrified, and believing T\u00farin dead, Ni\u00ebnor N\u00edniel killed herself by leaping into the ravines of the river.\nDeath[]\nN\u00edniel finds T\u00farin after the slaying of Glaurung, thinking he is dead - by Vigshane\nWhen T\u00farin awoke he was told by Brandir the Lame, lord of the Haladin of Brethil what had happened. In anger, he killed Brandir in front of many people, refusing to believe the truth. When he learned from Mablung of Doriath, who had come to seek him, that Brandir was telling truth and that he had wrongfully slain him, T\u00farin could no longer live with the pains and misfortunes of his life and determined to commit suicide. Just before his death, he revealed that he had been 'blind'; Morgoth's curse had had him groping in the dark since childhood.\nThen, T\u00farin said to Gurthang: \"Hail Gurthang, iron of death, thou alone now remainest!

The mound they were buried beneath survived the War of Wrath and Tol Morwen was the westernmost isle off the coast of Lindon in the Second and Third Ages.[3]\nWhether the tragedies in T\u00farin's life were the result of Morgoth's curse or of his own arrogance, or some combination of the two, are a subject of some debate among fans and scholars.",

Some conservative Gondorians feared that Eldacar's descendants would also have a short life and weaken the N\u00famen\u00f3rean blood of the kings. Thus, they did not want to accept Eldacar as their lord. When Valacar grew old, rebellion smoldered in the southern provinces.[4]\nValacar ruled Gondor for sixty-six years, and was succeeded by Eldacar when he died in the year 1432.[1] After Valacar's death, the rebellion turned into a civil war known as the Kin-strife.[6] This conflict lasted for fifteen years, until Eldacar secured the throne.[7]",

After Wulf took Edoras and \"called himself king\", his forces besieged the Rohirrim at the Hornburg in the refuge which would later be called Helm's Deep.\nWulf's army managed to kill Helm's first son, Haleth, while his younger son, H\u00e1ma, and the king himself perished during the siege at the Hornburg.

He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King D\u00e1in II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.\nLater years[]\nForty-eight years later, in TA 2989, \u00d3in went to Moria with Balin and Ori, along with many other Dwarves, to recover the realm for the Dwarves of Durin's Folk. After Balin became Lord of Moria, according to the Book of Mazarbul, \u00d3in was sent to look for the Upper Armories of the Third Deep, which were apparently westwards, near the Hollin Gate (the west gate out of Moria). Some five years passed, with \u00d3in at some point re-joining Balin, before the Moria Orcs attacked. The Dwarves could not escape by the eastern gate because the Orcs held the Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm, so they tried to escape by the Hollin Gate. However, the water outside the door was right up to the wall, and the Watcher in the Water \"took \u00d3in\".[3]\nIn TA 3018, the Fellowship of the Ring (including \u00d3in's nephew, Gimli) learned of the manner of \u00d3in's death after Gandalf read Ori's account in the Book of Mazarbul, in Balin's tomb chamber.",

His Pipe-weed business led to the herb's popularity throughout the Shire and beyond.[1][2]\nThe Pipe-weed variety 'Old Toby' was named after him, and 'Longbottom Leaf' possibly refers to his home where the plant was first cultivated in the Shire. According to Herblore of the Shire, by Meriadoc Brandybuck, it was believed that Tobold Hornblower learned about Pipe-weed in Bree, as that was the farthest from the Shire that he traveled and the herb was known to have grown on the south slopes of the hill there. His date of death is not recorded, but he likely died sometime in the twenty-seventh century of the Third Age.[3]",

        "biography": "Little is told of Gr\u00edma before he became advisor to Th\u00e9oden in Edoras. It is known that Gr\u00edma, son of G\u00e1lm\u00f3d, was secretly ensnared by Sauron's vassal, Saruman, and became his agent. Wormtongue informed the corrupted Wizard of every notable development throughout the realm and also weakened the ailing King, poisoning his mind and body with his deceitful counsels and false remedies for old age. It is likely that Saruman had promised him \u00c9owyn, the king's niece, as a reward for his services; Wormtongue is accused of \"watching her under his lids and haunting her steps.\" It is also possible that he had Dunlending ancestry, since he was darker-haired and physically smaller than the other Rohirrim.\nWormtongue as he began to influence Th\u00e9oden, by Donato Giancola\nThe main threats to Gr\u00edma's authority were Th\u00e9oden's son, Th\u00e9odred, and nephew, \u00c9omer. Failing to estrange the two, Wormtongue tried to portray them as rivals in the King's addled mind, as well as to paint \u00c9omer as an ambitious warmonger.\nAccording to one account, on September 20 in 3018, Gr\u00edma was on his way to Isengard to tell Saruman of Gandalf's arrival at Edoras. However, he was captured in the fields of Rohan by the Nazg\u00fbl, who were hunting for Gandalf. Gr\u00edma was interrogated and divulged what he knew of Saruman's plans to the Nazg\u00fbl, specifically his interest in the Shire and its location; this confirmed the corrupted Wizard's disloyalty to the Dark Lord. Previously, the location of the Shire had been unknown to the Nazg\u00fbl, but they knew it to be the home of \"Baggins,\" whom they thought still had the One Ring. Wormtongue was set free, for the Witch-king saw that he would not dare tell anyone of their meeting and he guessed that he would be of much use to Sauron (being a capable opportunist), while doing harm to the traitor Saruman in the future. The Ringwraiths set out immediately for the Shire. Had the Nazg\u00fbl not captured Gr\u00edma, they would instead have pursued Gandalf into Rohan, and possibly not have found the Shire until much later, giving the Hobbits and then the Fellowship of the Ring a considerable head start.[1]\nGr\u00edma and King Th\u00e9oden, under Saruman's spell, as Gandalf enters Meduseld\nAfter Gandalf ended Gr\u00edma's control of Th\u00e9oden and released the King, \"many things which men had missed\" were found locked in his trunk, including Herugrim, the blade of Th\u00e9oden. With his betrayal revealed, Th\u00e9oden presented Gr\u00edma with a choice: either ride into battle for the King or be exiled. Choosing the latter, he went to dwell with Saruman at Orthanc. Arriving there after the Ent attack, Gr\u00edma was captured and imprisoned by the Ents in Orthanc with Saruman. Later, Saruman had cause to regret Gr\u00edma's dwelling in Orthanc when, following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, he foolishly threw a \"heavy rock\"\u2014 which was actually the palant\u00edr of Orthanc at either Gandalf or Saruman (it is stated that \"he couldn't decide which he hated most\"), an act for which Saruman seems to have punished him severely. Peregrin Took picked up the palant\u00edr, which would play a role in defeating Saruman's master, Sauron. Saruman was also said to have scalped Wormtongue and beaten him over time.[2]\nAfter Treebeard granted them release, Gr\u00edma accompanied Saruman to the Shire, where the latter sought revenge in petty tyranny over the hobbits; the corrupted Wizard had already been exerting some control from afar through wicked Men in the Shire. During this time, Gr\u00edma became increasingly degraded until he was a crawling wretch, a beggar, almost resembling Gollum, and Saruman shortened his nickname to \"Worm\". Eventually, Gr\u00edma killed Lotho Sackville-Baggins and may have eaten him, which he claimed to have done under Saruman's orders.\nAfter overthrowing the Ruffians, Wormtongue was initially ready to follow his master out of the Shire. Frodo Baggins attempted to convince him that he no longer needed to follow Saruman, and that he was not evil in his heart. Saruman then mockingly exposed Gr\u00edma for murdering Lotho. Angry, he argued that Saruman made him do it, but Saruman responded by mocking and kicking him. This proved to be the last straw for Grima, who finally had enough of his master's physical and verbal abuse he had endured for years. Gr\u00edma then used a hidden knife to slit Saruman's throat from behind, killing him. Bewildered by this act and overcome with great shame and anxiety, he cowardly tried to escape but was quickly killed by several arrows fired from the Hobbits present, ending his life.[3]",

        "biography": "Early life\nD\u00e9agol and Sm\u00e9agol fishing, in the films\nOriginally a hobbit of the Stoor-country, born in TA 2430, Sm\u00e9agol spent the early years of his life living with his extended family under a Matriarch, his grandmother. Around the year 2463, Sm\u00e9agol became the fourth Bearer of the One Ring, after Sauron, Isildur, and D\u00e9agol. D\u00e9agol was his cousin, and on Sm\u00e9agol's birthday, they went fishing in the Gladden Fields. It was there that D\u00e9agol found a gold Ring in the water, after being pulled out of their boat by a large fish. Almost immediately, Sm\u00e9agol fell to the power of the Ring, demanding it as a birthday present. When D\u00e9agol refused, Sm\u00e9agol promptly flew into a rage and fought with D\u00e9agol over the Ring, choking him to death and taking the Ring as his own. Sm\u00e9agol was quickly corrupted further by the Ring and banished by his people; turned by his grandmother out of her hole, he was forced to find a home in a cave in the Misty Mountains in around TA 2470. The Ring's malignant influence twisted his Hobbit body, as well as his mind, and prolonged his life far beyond its natural limits. He called it his \"Precious\" or his \"birthday-present\", the latter as a replacement in his mind for killing D\u00e9agol.[1]\nLife under the Misty Mountains\nGollum seeing light for the first time after his transformation, by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bennett\nHe lived in the Misty Mountains for over four hundred years, living on raw blind fish (which he caught from his small boat), bats, and occasionally, stray Orcs. Gollum even made a song about raw fish, which is \"The rocks and stones! They're like old bones all bare of meat!\" that he used as a riddle to Bilbo, and would much later sing to Frodo Baggins in a longer version. He found Hobbit and Elven food repulsive.\nDuring his centuries under the Ring's influence, he developed a sort of dissociative identity disorder: Sm\u00e9agol, his \"good\" personality, still vaguely remembered things like friendship and love, while Gollum, his \"bad\" and prevailing personality, was a slave to the Ring and would kill anyone who tried to take it. Years later, Samwise Gamgee would name the good personality \"Slinker\" (for his fawning, eager-to-please demeanor), and the bad personality \"Stinker\". The two personalities often quarreled when he talked to himself (as J.R.R. Tolkien put it, \"through not having anyone else to speak to\") and had a love/hate relationship, mirroring Gollum's love and hatred for the Ring and for himself.\nGollum living in the Misty Mountains\nIn July, TA 2941, during the Quest of Erebor, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins stumbled upon the dark lake on which he lived and found Gollum's Ring. Gollum had lost the Ring while squabbling with an imp goblin in the network of caves leading to the lake, though in fact it is more proper to say that the Ring abandoned Gollum, for it was known to have a will of its own. As Gandalf says later, it looks after itself, trying to get back to Sauron. After the infamous riddle-game, during which Gollum was unaware of his loss, Gollum refused to show Bilbo the promised way out and plotted to murder him. When he went to get his \"birthday present,\" however, he found that it was gone. He suddenly realized the true answer to Bilbo's last riddle\u2014\"What have I got in my pocket?\" -, breaking into a rage and then begun to chase him in the tunnels. Bilbo inadvertently stumbled across the Ring's power of invisibility as he ran, allowing him to follow Gollum to the back entrance of the cave. There, Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum, but was overcome with pity, so he jumped over him to escape. As Bilbo ran, Gollum cried out, \"Thief! Thief, Baggins! Curse it and crush it! We hates it forever!\"; he did not immediately follow Bilbo out of fear of being caught by the goblins, and so lingered in his cave.[2]\nGollum with Bilbo, as imagined by Darrell Sweet\nSearch for the Ring\nGollum eventually left the Mountains and pursued Bilbo a few years later, but the trail was cold. He made his way south to Mordor where all evil was being drawn at the time, discovering the secret Stairs of Cirith Ungol located near Minas Morgul and surviving an encounter with Shelob. He was captured on his return, taken to the dungeons of Barad-d\u00fbr and forced to reveal to Sauron under intense torture what he knew about the Ring. Gollum was then freed, as Sauron had learned all he needed from him and sensed he might draw out the Ring. He was then subsequently caught by Aragorn, then interrogated by Gandalf, who placed him in the care of the Silvan Elves living in Thranduil's kingdom in Mirkwood. Assisted by Orcs, he escaped them, and set off looking for the Shire. He passed through Moria, but could not make it out of the Doors of Durin. Seemingly, he then just waited there until he got lucky when the Fellowship of the Ring passed through. However, as Frodo was a ring-bearer, he might have foreseen the passing of the Ring. Alternatively, some of Saruman's or Sauron's spies may have revealed to him the Fellowship was heading towards Moria.[3]\nGollum on the hunt for Bilbo, by Eric Velhagen\nThe War of the Ring\nGollum met and started following the Fellowship of the Ring in Moria and was spotted and heard by Frodo on several occasions. On January 15, 3019, the Fellowship was divided when Gandalf disappeared while fighting a Balrog (though he later returned). Gollum continued trailing the remaining members. It is unknown how he crossed the broken Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm, but he came with them to L\u00f3rien without their knowing. Gollum followed their boats down Anduin (floating on a log) to Nen Hithoel and pursued Frodo and Sam across the Emyn Muil when they struck out on their own towards Mordor. Gollum followed them, but after a confrontation (in which he bit and nearly strangled Sam for the Ring), Frodo subdued him and threatened to kill him with Sting, the Elvish blade that Gollum had apparently recognized by its former owner - Bilbo. Sam tied an elven-rope around Gollum's neck for a leash, which inflicted great pain on Gollum. Taking pity, Frodo made Gollum swear to help them. Agreeing to the oath, Gollum swore by the \"Precious\" itself as the Ring was treacherous and would hold Gollum to his word, so Frodo released him to show them the way to Mordor. The unlikely company, guided by Gollum, made its way to the Black Gate of Mordor.\nGollum's spying eyes in the Mines of Moria\nAlong the way, it was revealed that Gollum, having lived in a cave for hundreds of years, feared both the Sun and the Moon, calling them the 'Yellow Face' and the 'White Face' respectively.\nFrodo's kindness brought out the \"Sm\u00e9agol\" personality, and he made at least some effort to keep his promise. The two had a strange sort of bond from both having been Ring-bearers; in Gollum, Frodo saw his possible future, and so wanted to save him so he could save himself. Apart from Gandalf and Bilbo, Frodo was the only person known to have shown kindness towards Gollum, who was hated instantly by everyone he met, being perceived as filthy, slimy, sneaky and suspect by groups as different as the Orcs of Cirith Ungol and the Rangers of Ithilien.\nWhen the Black Gate was reached and found to be well guarded, Gollum convinced them not to go that way, saying that they would be caught and Sauron would regain the Ring. Gollum said he would lead them south, where he knew of another entrance into Mordor, in which Frodo complied, despite Sam's suspicions.\nFrodo and Sam were caught by Faramir, and Gollum followed them. When Frodo allowed Faramir to briefly take Gollum prisoner, however, he felt betrayed, allowing the \"Gollum\" personality to take total control. Faramir found out that the place Gollum was taking them was called Cirith Ungol. He then warned Frodo and Sam of the evil of that place.\nGollum leading Sam and Frodo up the dangerous stairs along the Morgul Vale, by Stephen Hickman\nFrodo, Sam, and Gollum left Faramir and began crossing the Morgul Vale and proceeded to climb the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, in the border-mountains of the Ephel D\u00faath (Mountains of Shadow). Gollum visited the great spider Shelob, child of Ungoliant, because he was planning to betray the hobbits by turning them to Shelob for food and then take the Ring for himself. The fact that Gollum managed to forge an alliance with Shelob is also remarkable, as she was otherwise known for devouring and killing everything on sight. When he returned, the hobbits were asleep. The sight of Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent, as he began to pet Frodo's hair. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to Gollum and all hope of redemption was lost. Gollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into Torech Ungol.\nJust as Faramir warned them, Gollum did betray them, as after leading them into Shelob's lair, Gollum disappeared and waited for Shelob to kill them so he could claim the Ring for himself. When Shelob started chasing after Frodo, Gollum used this opportunity to attack Sam. However, he was no match for Sam, who gained the upper-hand, forcing Gollum to retreat.\nFrodo and Sam escaped from her lair and also Cirith Ungol. They came against all odds to the fiery volcano Mount Doom. Gollum followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, he attacked, but failed to get the Ring. Sam, who had hated Gollum on sight, tried to bring himself to kill him, but he relented out of sheer pity and disgust, turning his back on the beaten (but still wily) creature.\nDeath\nMoments later, Frodo was standing on the edge of the Cracks of Doom, but, unable to destroy the Ring, claimed it for himself and put it on. Then, Gollum attacked the hobbits again. He knocked out Sam with a rock whilst Frodo was invisible, and then, tracking his footprints, jumped on Frodo's shoulders.  The two fought and Gollum ultimately bit off Frodo's finger with the ring on it.\nHere, Bilbo's long-ago kindness in sparing Gollum's life was rewarded, as Gollum then teetered on the edge of the great pit, overjoyed with finally reclaiming his \"precious\" until losing his balance and falling into the molten lava below while still holding the Ring, causing his own death and, indirectly, the Ring's utter destruction. Had Bilbo taken Gollum's life early on, the chance of Sauron's regaining the Ring would have greatly increased as he knew where Frodo was as soon as he put it on.\nLegacy\nFrodo did forgive Gollum, as Gandalf had pointed out to him that Gollum was not an evil entity deserving death, but a pitiful being unnaturally and irreversibly bound to the Ring's will, and that Frodo would have almost certainly suffered a similar fate had he kept the Ring.\nGollum in his cave, by Anato Finnstark",

        "biography": "Years of the Lamps[]\nRadagast as a Maia named Aiwendil before leaving the Undying Lands, by Moi-Keiniku-Sang\nOriginally named Aiwendil (Quenya: \"Friend to birds\"), Radagast was a Maia created before Time who descended into Arda to serve the Valar.[1] Aiwendil served the Vali\u00eb Yavanna, Queen of the earth.\nWhen the Undying Lands were separated from Arda after the Downfall of N\u00famenor, Manw\u00eb was still concerned for the fate of the peoples of Middle-earth. Though Sauron had been overthrown, he had not been permanently vanquished. In time, his shadow began to emerge again. A council of the Valar was summoned, and it was decided that they would send emissaries to Middle-earth. These messengers should be \"mighty peers of Sauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh,\" as they were intended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron. These emissaries themselves, the wizards, did not match the Dark Lord in power. Aul\u00eb chose Curumo (Saruman), Orom\u00eb chose Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards), and Manw\u00eb chose Ol\u00f3rin (Gandalf). Yavanna subsequently begged Curumo to take Aiwendil with him.\n\nThird Age[]\nArrival in Middle-earth[]\nAround the year TA 1000, the Maia arrived at the Grey Havens in the west of Eriador, having the form of old Men, whom the peoples called Wizards. Curumo arrived first and alone, and Aiwendil arrived at the same time as Ol\u00f3rin.[2] When the Wizards took their mission, they roamed Middle-earth. In this period, Aiwendil was renamed \"Radagast\" by the \u00d1oldor and became known for both his protection of the great Forests and his zeal for the animals, worrying little with the affairs of Men and Elves, but was far more knowledgeable in plants, birds and beasts in the forest. He also turned away from Saruman during this period, unaware that the White Wizard despised him and considered him a fool.\nRadagast in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.\nIn general, Radagast was never much of a traveler.[3] There is little told of his early journeys, but by the late Third Age, he had settled down and dwelt for a time at Rhosgobel, somewhere between the Carrock and the Menn-i-Naugrim.[2] Situated on the western edge of Mirkwood, the Wizard likely held watch against the shadow of Dol Guldur that slowly engulfed much of the forest. He likely became acquainted with that region's inhabitants. Close to animals and birds, he was friends with the Great Eagles.[3] Although the neighboring Beorn was unsociable, he saw Radagast from time to time and considered him \"not bad\" for a Wizard.[4]\nWar of the Ring[]\nIn TA 2851, the White Council met once more, after which Saruman began to search the Gladden Fields for the One Ring. Radagast decided to aid his search, with birds and beasts acting as spies, hoping that Saruman's actions would help keep watch and hinder Sauron. Radagast did this in good faith, knowing nothing of Saruman's true ambition to acquire and keep the Ring for himself.[5]\nBy the War of the Ring, Radagast no longer dwelt in Rhosgobel. In summer of TA 3018, Saruman told Radagast that he was willing to help Gandalf and sent the Brown Wizard to seek Gandalf at once. Radagast knew little of Eriador but sought for the Shire, knowing that he would find Gandalf nearby.[3]\nIndeed, on Midsummer's Day, Radagast was sitting on the side of the Greenway with his horse near Bree when Gandalf found him on his way to the village. Radagast warned Gandalf that the Nazg\u00fbl were abroad, disguised as riders in black, seeking news of the Shire. He also gave Gandalf Saruman's invitation and agreed to help Gandalf by having beasts and birds to send news to Orthanc. With that he rode away back towards Mirkwood.[3]\nRadagast the Brown during the War of the Ring\nSaruman's message proved to be a trap for Gandalf who, after coming to Orthanc, was imprisoned; but Gandalf still believed that Radagast was not under Saruman's sway. Indeed, it was thanks to Radagast that Gandalf was able to escape from the pinnacle of Orthanc upon the wings of Gwaihir.[3]\nRadagast's actions during and after the rest of the War are not recorded. After the Council of Elrond, scouts were sent out from Rivendell to many different locations. Some passed over the Misty Mountains and eventually came to Rhosgobel, but found that Radagast was not there.[6] His fate after the War of the Ring is untold,[2] however, as his task had been to oppose Sauron, his powers likely would have dwindled if he remained in Middle-earth after Mordor's destruction.\n",

        "biography": "Years of the Lamps\nGandalf as a Maia named Ol\u00f3rin before leaving the Undying Lands - by Annie Claudine\nOriginally called Ol\u00f3rin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by Il\u00favatar before the Music of the Ainur,[1] and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into E\u00e4.[2] In his \"youth\" he became one of the Maiar who served Manw\u00eb, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda,[3] yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Il\u00favatar and drawing those who listened to him out of despair.[3]\nWhen the Valar decided to send the Istari (also called Wizards) to Middle-earth to counsel and assist all those who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, Manw\u00eb and Varda included Ol\u00f3rin among the five to be sent. At first, Ol\u00f3rin was nervous and described himself as too weak and afraid of Sauron. Manw\u00eb understood, and told Ol\u00f3rin that such was a reason why he should go, to overcome that fear. Furthermore, the One Ring, containing much of Sauron's power, presumably still existed somewhere. Thus, Manw\u00eb insisted that Ol\u00f3rin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him to send Ol\u00f3rin as the second instead.[4] He agreed, and prepared for Ol\u00f3rin's departure from the Undying Lands with the other four, arriving about the same time that the Necromancer appeared in Mirkwood.\nThird Age\nArrival in Middle-earth\nOl\u00f3rin, like the other Wizards, took the shape of an old man. He was robed in grey and wandered about as a counsellor. At Mithlond he was welcomed by Glorfindel, his friend from Valinor (who had been sent earlier on a similar mission), and C\u00edrdan the shipwright who possessed Narya, one of the Three Elven Rings of Power. C\u00edrdan divined in Ol\u00f3rin a sense of strength and power despite his appearance as a bent and aged man. C\u00edrdan gave Narya to Ol\u00f3rin with a prediction of his future struggles with evil, and a promise that it would support and aid him in his labours.[5]\nGandalf the Grey wandering Middle-earth, by Robert Zigo\nGandalf, by Jay Johnstone\nHe then began his sojourn in Middle-earth and over many centuries, he walked among the Elves as a stranger, learning from them and teaching them. Unlike Saruman, Ol\u00f3rin never took up permanent residence, and never went to the east, apparently restricting his activities to the Westlands of Middle-earth, where the remnants of the D\u00fanedain and the Eldar remained to oppose Sauron. He was known by many names during the long years he wandered: Elves named him Mithrandir, the \"Grey Pilgrim\", while the Men of Arnor coined Gandalf, which became his most common name. He was also known as Inc\u00e1nus in the South and as Thark\u00fbn to the Dwarves.[4] He later revealed himself as one of the Istari, and eventually became known as not only the wisest but also the most powerful of them.\nA legend tells that Gandalf had been given by Yavanna the Elfstone of E\u00e4rendil, to bring to the peoples of Middle-earth as a token that the Valar had not forsook them. He gave this to Galadriel, bearer of one of the three Elven Rings and mighty among the Eldar, who prophesied that she would in turn pass it to one who would also be called Elessar.[6]\nReemergence of the Necromancer\nAround year TA 1100, the Istari and Eldar discovered that some evil entity resided in at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood; while some thought a Nazg\u00fbl had returned to torment the world, or some new evil was arising, Gandalf began to suspect that perhaps Sauron himself might have returned.[5][7] As in the next two hundred years, evil continued to grow and spread, as well as the source directing it. Gandalf went to Dol Guldur in TA 2063 to discover its secret.[5] However, the Necromancer fled upon Gandalf's arrival, preventing Gandalf from identifying him.[7] After Gandalf's incursion, the evil there seemed to desist, and its absence allowed for some centuries of calmness.[7]\nIan McKellen as Gandalf in the late Third age\nThat peaceful period was known as the Watchful Peace and lasted for almost four hundred years, but the Nazg\u00fbl had used this period to prepare for Sauron's return, in TA 2460.[5] Realising the returning evil, Galadriel formed and reunited the White Council three years later composed of four members: herself, Gandalf, Saruman, and Elrond the Half-elf (who was the bearer of another of the Three Rings). Galadriel wished Gandalf to be the chief of the Council, but he refused the position, wishing to set down no roots and to maintain his independence; Saruman took this place instead because of his vast knowledge and skill.[7] However, he later grew jealous and afraid of Gandalf,[5] which was one of the reasons for his future betrayal.\nDuring his wanderings in Eriador, Gandalf met and befriended the isolated and secretive people of the Hobbits in their country, the Shire. During the Long Winter of TA 2758 Gandalf came to their aid.[5] It was then when he witnessed and admired the pity and courage that the humble Hobbits reserved in their hearts.[8] \nHe then passed onward but nevertheless would return to visit the Shire occasionally and participate in the Midsummer-eve parties of the Old Took, where he impressed young Hobbits with his fireworks, and his stories about Dragons, Goblins and princesses.[8] He was thus known to be \"responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures\". He also met a relatively adventurous Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, although he was in fact far from \"adventuresome.\"[9]\nGandalf finds Thr\u00e1in in the dungeons of Dol Guldur\nWhen King Thr\u00e1in II, a Dwarf of the royal line of Durin, disappeared on journey to Erebor, Gandalf looked for him. At some point after TA 2845 he entered the abandoned city of Khazad-d\u00fbm during this search. After this proved to be in vain, the Wizard exited through the Doors of Durin; however this experience did not help him know how to open the doors from the outside.[10] In TA 2850, his quest led him once more to Dol Guldur, this time in secrecy.[5] He found Thr\u00e1in in the dungeons, who gave the Wizard his last possessions, the map and key to Erebor.[11] Most importantly, he found out that the Necromancer was not a Nazg\u00fbl \u2013 it was Sauron himself, and he had taken the last of the Seven Rings from the Dwarf King; Sauron was gathering the remaining Rings of Power and possibly searching for his lost One Ring.\nThe White Council meeting on the question of Dol Guldur\nGandalf escaped Dol Guldur and returned to the White Council.[7] After relating his discoveries, he urged the council to attack Sauron while the One Ring was still lost and while Sauron's power was not yet beginning to be restored . But Saruman said that it was better to watch and wait; that the One Ring had long ago rolled from Anduin to the Sea. The majority of the council agreed with Saruman. Elrond later privately told Gandalf he had a foreboding that the Ring would be found, and that the war to end the Age was coming. Indeed, Elrond added, he feared that it would end in darkness and despair. Gandalf encouraged him, saying there were many \"strange chances,\" and that, \"help oft shall come from the hands of the weak\". Gandalf did not yet realize that Saruman now wanted the Ring for himself and was secretly searching for it along the banks of the River Anduin.\nAs time went on, the wizard became increasingly troubled by his knowledge of Sauron's resurgent strength. He knew that Sauron was already plotting war from Dol Guldur, and that as soon as he felt strong enough, he would attack Rivendell. Unfortunately, the only power left besides Rivendell to resist an attempt from Mirkwood to regain the lands of Angmar were the isolated Dwarves of the Iron Hills.\nQuest of Erebor\nMain article: Quest of Erebor\nConception of a plan\nOver the years, Gandalf became concerned about the weak state of the North. Smaug the dragon had destroyed both the Kingdom under the Mountain and the town of Dale, and the wizard feared that Sauron might use the desolation around Erebor to regain the northern passes in the mountains and reclaim the old lands of Angmar. Worse still, Gandalf knew that it was only a matter of time before the Dark Lord  regained enough power to exert influence over Smaug. With the dragon at his command, Sauron's victory would be all but assured.\nGandalf knew that exiled Dwarf King of Durin's Folk, Thorin II, planned to battle against Smaug, but he knew that it would not be enough. In TA 2941,[5] while staying the night in Bree, Gandalf happened across the Dwarf King.[8] Thorin initiated conversation; he had been having a strange feeling urging him to seek Gandalf. The same was intrigued, for he had thought to seek Thorin as well. They found they were taking the same road for a while (Thorin passing through the Shire on his way to the Ered Luin), and they agreed to travel together. Thorin wanted advice, and Gandalf in turn wanted to discuss the dragon Smaug with Thorin.\nUltimately, Gandalf concocted a plan wherein Thorin could destroy Smaug and recover his family fortune, albeit with a \"burglar\" of Gandalf's own choosing.\nLeading the company\nGandalf invites Bilbo Baggins on an adventure\nFeeling that a Hobbit should be involved, Gandalf remembered Bilbo Baggins. At first he found only Holman Cotton as Bilbo had left on the occasion of the Elven new year, something that persuaded Gandalf that Bilbo was the right person for the job.[8] He visited Bilbo later, bringing along the kinsmen of Thorin.[9] In the end, Gandalf convinced the reluctant Baggins to become a burglar for Thorin. Gandalf then accompanied Thorin and Company to Rivendell. During the journey Gandalf was instrumental in saving the travellers' lives from several calamities. He saved them from a trio of Stone-trolls, and later obtained the legendary sword Glamdring from their Troll-hoard; Gandalf bore it thenceforth.[12]\nHe also helped Thorin and Company through the Misty Mountains; when unknowingly they camped in the Front Porch of Goblin-town, the Northern Orcs captured the whole company except Gandalf, who surprised them much later, killing the Great Goblin and then leading the Dwarves to the Goblin-gate.[13] It was during this time that Bilbo obtained a \"magic ring\".[14] Bilbo initially claimed he \"won\" it from the creature \"Gollum\" while the company was under the Misty Mountains.[15] The Ring conferred invisibility on Bilbo when he wore it, and he kept it secret from Gandalf for some time.\nOn their escape out, the Company was saved by the Eagles of the Misty Mountains; Gandalf once had healed the Lord of the Eagles from an arrow-wound, and thenceforth they became friends. The Eagles picked them up from the Great Shelf, and the next day they dropped them off on the Carrock.[15]\nPressing business\nGandalf, by Donato Giancola\nGandalf then sought the hospitality of Beorn, persuading him to welcome and host the whole Company in his hall. But then he left the quest prior to its completion; after leading the Company to the outskirts of the Forest Gate, he gave them some final advice before they entered Mirkwood, and went to attend other obligations.[16][17] The White Council had met under the gravest of circumstances: Sauron's power was returning, even without his Ring. Gandalf at last convinced the Council to attack Dol Guldur, to which even Saruman agreed (as by now he feared Sauron as a rival, and wished to delay his search for the Ring). Gandalf joined his peers in assailing Dol Guldur, ridding Mirkwood of the Necromancer's presence, who fled to Mordor to his long-prepared stronghold of Barad-d\u00fbr.[18] When he was about to finish his task, news about what happened to Thorin's Company in Mirkwood reached him, and realized that the instructions he gave did not help them; they had lost their way, and then vanished due to the encounter with the Wood-elves, who had captured them. He was anxious to get back to them as soon as possible.[19]\nThe Battle of Five Armies\nMeanwhile Thorin's quest was successful: Erebor was retaken and Smaug was killed,[20] but when Gandalf finally arrived to the area, he found the Dwarves of Erebor and the Iron Hills preparing for an attack by the Lake-men and the Elves of Mirkwood. He was with Bard and Thranduil and thus revealed his presence, trying to reason with Thorin. When the attack was beginning, Gandalf halted them, to warn that the Orcs and Wargs were coming to claim the treasure. He invited D\u00e1in Ironfoot for council, and soon Dwarves, Elves and Men formed an alliance, and defeated the Orcs of the Misty Mountains in the Battle of Five Armies.[21]\nKing Thorin was mortally wounded and, after his funeral and the reestablishment of Erebor under D\u00e1in, Bilbo and Gandalf followed their way back; they celebrated Yule at Beorn's, and then returned to Rivendell, where he discussed with Elrond the events of Dol Guldur and the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf had accomplished his immediate goal, which was to destroy Smaug, since he could have been used to disastrous effect by Sauron. A large number of Orcs and Wargs also were killed in the North, removing threats to Rivendell and Lothl\u00f3rien.[8] The two agreed that it would be better if the Necromancer were banished from the world altogether.[22]\nAs Gandalf and Bilbo passed by the site of their former encounter with the stone-trolls, they made sure to recover the gold of the troll-hoard they had buried before the Wizard left to perform other duties and Bilbo returned to the Shire.[22] Gandalf, for his part, found himself amazed by the Hobbit; until then, the Wise had paid no attention to Hobbits and knew little of them. For the rest of his sojourn in Middle-earth, Gandalf took a special interest in Hobbits, and particularly in the Baggins family.\nReturn of the Shadow\n\"A Light in the Dark\", by Matthew Stewart\nThe White Council's last meeting, as illustrated by Alan Lee\nDespite the Council's hopes, Sauron was not weakened by this attack. He had foreseen the move that drove him from Mirkwood, and his retreat was but a feint. Ten years after the attack, Sauron declared himself openly in Mordor in 2951 and rebuilt his fortress of Barad-d\u00fbr. The White Council met for one last time in 2953 to debate the fate of the Rings of Power. Saruman quieted his peers claiming to have the knowledge that the One Ring was lost in the Belegaer. After their meeting, Saruman, jealous and afraid of Gandalf, set spies to watch all his movements; this would affect the peaceful Hobbits, as Saruman thus discovered the existence and noted Gandalf's interest in the Shire, and started sending agents to Bree and the Southfarthing.[5]\nIn 2956, Gandalf met Aragorn, the hidden Heir of Isildur, and soon became friends with him. From that point on Aragorn and Gandalf often worked together towards a common end - the defeat of Sauron.\nReturn to the Shire\nDuring this period Gandalf visited the Shire frequently, especially his friend Bilbo Baggins, and his younger nephew, Frodo. He noted Bilbo's unusual youthfulness, despite his advancing age; the suspicious \"magic ring\" that Bilbo had acquired during his adventure began to weigh on his mind. Gandalf recalled the deceit Bilbo used in originally claiming it for his own\u2014Bilbo had later admitted to stealing it from Gollum. Gandalf could see that Bilbo was now very preoccupied with the Ring and had begun to suspect that the same was indeed a ring of power. Such un-hobbitlike behaviour aroused his suspicions.\nGandalf entering Hobbiton, by Darrell Sweet\nIn 3001, Bilbo planned what would become known as his Farewell Birthday Party, and at the culmination of the hobbit's speech, Bilbo put on the mysterious Ring and disappeared, as a joke on his neighbors. Later as he was bidding farewell to Gandalf, who had known about his plans to leave, Bilbo began to change his mind about leaving his Ring to Frodo, as he had earlier agreed. When Gandalf tried to persuade him to leave it, Bilbo became hostile and accused Gandalf of trying to steal the Ring for his own benefit, which he referred to as his \"precious.\" Horrified by Bilbo's outburst, Gandalf stood to his full height and projected his power, frightening the hobbit. This brought Bilbo back to his senses; he apologized, admitting that the Ring had been troubling him lately, and begrudgingly left it behind. Bilbo and Gandalf bid each other goodbye before Bilbo left the Shire for his journey.[23] Before leaving the Shire, he spoke with Frodo, emphatically warning him not to use the Ring.[24]\nGandalf in the library at Minas Tirith, by Jay Johnstone\nSearching for the Ring\nKeen now to find out more about Gollum, he sought Aragorn's help to capture him. Studying the records in Minas Tirith, he found the Scroll of Isildur and pieced together the missing history of the One Ring. In TA 3017 on his way back to the Shire he got word from the Galadhrim that Aragorn had finally captured Gollum and he went to Mirkwood to meet him. For days he interrogated him in order to verify what he already suspected. A great fear came over him when he learned that Gollum had been to the Tower of Barad-d\u00fbr. Sauron had tortured Gollum and learned not only of the \"magic ring\", but also the names \"Shire\" and \"Baggins\". Gandalf left Mirkwood soon after, and left Gollum with the Wood-elves of Northern Mirkwood.[5] He now returned in haste to the Shire, certain that Frodo's ring was not simply a ring of power: it was the One Ruling Ring of Sauron.\nWar of the Ring\nMain article: War of the Ring\nUpon returning to the Shire, Gandalf immediately went to Frodo and confirmed his suspicions by throwing the Ring into Frodo's hearth fire, which revealed, in Black Speech, the inscription upon the Ring. Gandalf then told a dumbfounded Frodo about the One Ring and its history, and how Sauron would seek to regain it. Instructing Frodo to go to Rivendell with the Ring, Gandalf told him to make arrangements to leave the Shire quietly.\nGandalf telling Frodo of the Ring, by Donato Giancola\nWhile in the Shire, he had a sense of foreboding; in the aftermath of Sauron's assault on Osgiliath, Gandalf heard disturbing news about war in Gondor and a Black Shadow. He started wandering around Eriador, hearing news from the refugees who had a fear they could not speak about, until he met Radagast the Brown who brought a message from Saruman that he must seek him at once; and a warning that the Ringwraiths were looking for the Shire.[25] He went to The Prancing Pony at Bree. Believing that he would not be able to return to Frodo in time, he wrote a letter, urging him to move as soon as possible for Rivendell, and seek a \"Strider\" whose real name was Aragorn, along with a riddle to identify him; Gandalf would then try to catch up with them when available. He also instructed Barliman Butterbur to send the letter to Hobbiton and to expect a Mr. Baggins that would come under the name of \"Mr. Underhill\". He left the inn, but Barliman would forget to send the letter.[26]\nSaruman's betrayal\nI keep a clearer memory of your arguments, and deeds, than you suppose. When last I visited you, you were the jailor of Mordor, and there I was to be sent.\u2014Gandalf to Saruman, The Lord of the Rings, Vol. II: The Two Towers, Book Three, Ch. X: \"The Voice of Saruman\"\nGwaihir bearing Gandalf away from Orthanc, by Stephen Hickman\nSoon thereafter Gandalf arrived at Isengard to consult with Saruman. At their meeting, Saruman finally revealed himself as \"an ally, or servant of Sauron\" and offered his \"old friend and helper\" two choices: to rule Middle-earth together with the Dark Lord or wield the Ring's power for themselves. Gandalf refused \"to submit to Sauron, or to [Saruman]\", and was imprisoned on the pinnacle of Orthanc. Gandalf was aware that Saruman would try to coerce the Ring's whereabouts out of him and then hand him over to Sauron in Mordor. But the Grey Pilgrim was saved from such a fate: Gwaihir the Windlord, soon arrived and helped Gandalf escape. Gwaihir's real purpose for visiting Orthanc was to report a sighting of the Nazg\u00fbl, as Radagast had appealed to him to do so earlier on. Gandalf knew he must return quickly to the Shire, as Frodo (and the Ring) were in grave danger from both Sauron's chief agents: the Nazg\u00fbl and now Saruman, who actually wanted the Ring for himself.\nJourney to Rivendell\nGandalf hurriedly went to Rohan, desiring to find a strong steed; there he obtained Shadowfax from King Th\u00e9oden, who later resented the gift. This mighty horse and Gandalf forged a special bond, and Gandalf made quick use of Shadowfax's incredible strength and endurance.\nGandalf sped to the Shire. Fortunately, Frodo had already left the Shire without waiting for Gandalf, and was seeking the refuge of Rivendell. Upon arrival, Gandalf learned that the Nazg\u00fbl, arrayed as Black Riders, had been searching the area. Dismayed, he set out for Bree; Barliman apologised to Gandalf for forgetting to send the letter, worried that the hobbits had left with Strider, the suspicious Ranger. But for Gandalf, this was a hope which far exceeded his expectations. After congratulating a puzzled Barliman, and blessing his beer, Gandalf then made for Weathertop, a high point in the region, to observe the surrounding area.\nGandalf fighting the Nazg\u00fbl, as illustrated by Ted Nasmith\nThere he was assaulted at night by the Nazg\u00fbl, but drove them off after a great battle of light and flame. These phenomena were seen by Aragorn and the hobbits from afar, without knowing it was Gandalf. Before leaving, he marked some stones with the cirth G for them to find, then fled east, drawing four of the Ringwraiths after him.\nSeveral days later, Frodo, Aragorn, and company stayed at Weathertop and were confronted by the remaining five Nazg\u00fbl. Despite their escape, Frodo was stabbed in the process by the Lord of the Nazg\u00fbl with a Morgul-knife.[27] Gandalf was able to evade the four Nazg\u00fbl and successfully reach Rivendell and was welcomed by Glorfindel. However, several days later, an injured Frodo arrived at the Ford of Bruinen, though the Nazg\u00fbl pursued him all the way there. Gandalf, along with Elrond, saved Frodo from the Nazg\u00fbl by enchanting the water and sweeping them away.[28]\nForming of the Fellowship\nElrond called a council after Frodo was healed to consider the momentous decision regarding the Ring. There Gandalf explained to the others how he had been imprisoned in Isengard and how Saruman was building his own army of Orcs to eventually betray Sauron, his new master.[25] By chance, representatives of most of the free peoples happened to be in Rivendell already for various reasons. Elrond and Gandalf advised that the Ring should be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was made. Others dissented or objected, but eventually submitted to Gandalf's plan. Ultimately, Elrond appointed the Fellowship of the Ring as nine walkers, numerically set against Sauron's nine Nazg\u00fbl. The relatively small number reflected the realisation by Elrond and the other council members that the Quest of Mount Doom would not rely upon strength of arms, but on stealth and good fortune. Gandalf was chosen to lead the company, which included Aragorn, Boromir of Gondor, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and the hobbits Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin Took, and Meriadoc Brandybuck.\nGandalf leading the Fellowship through Eregion\nSeveral obstacles stood in the company's way. Gandalf was determined not to lead the company near Isengard, so the vast Misty Mountains had to be crossed. Gandalf decided to take a southern route to the Redhorn Pass and cross the mountains that way, traversing the mountain range and avoiding Isengard. When this attempt failed due to a terrible storm, he then decided to take the Fellowship through the ruins of Moria, where the remains of the great Dwarf city of Khazad-d\u00fbm was now a labyrinth of abandoned tunnels under the mountains. Others in the company were loathe to enter the maze, as it was now the lair of Orcs and something known only as \"Durin's Bane\".\nGandalf the Grey, by Giovani Bellofatto\nFall in Moria\nAt the Doors of Durin on the west side of the mountains, Gandalf, after some delay, spoke the password and led the company into the dark. Having been in Moria on an earlier perilous errand, he was somewhat familiar with the underground passages. Eventually the party came to the Chamber of Mazarbul, where Gandalf read the Book of Records, which revealed the fate of Balin, the leader of an ill-fated attempt to re-colonise Moria. Soon after, the party was attacked by Orcs, and forced to flee the chamber. By then Gandalf was well aware of their location, and he led the party quickly towards the eastern exit.\nYou cannot pass,\" he said. The Orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. \"I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Ud\u00fbn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.\u2014The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I: The Fellowship of the Ring, Book II, Ch. 5: \"The Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm\"\nGandalf and the Balrog\nUnfortunately Durin's Bane caught up to the group at the Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm. Gandalf and Legolas immediately realised what it was: a Balrog of Morgoth, a servant of the first Dark Lord. In a spectacular display of bravery, Gandalf faced the demon and broke the bridge both stood upon, leaving the beast to fall into a seemingly bottomless chasm. But the Balrog's whip lashed out, and grasped Gandalf by the knees, causing him to fall into the pit. While falling, Gandalf shouted \"Fly, you fools\" and vanished into the abyss.[29]\nGandalf dueling on Zirakzigil, by Raoul Vitale\nYet Gandalf did not die; he and the Balrog fell for a long time, and the wizard was burned by the Balrog's fire. Then they plunged into a deep lake in the depths of the mountain, which Gandalf later said was cold as the tide of death and almost froze his heart. They fought in the water until finally the Balrog fled into dark tunnels, where the world was gnawed by nameless things, older even than Sauron. Gandalf pursued the creature until it led him to the spiralling Endless Stair, and they climbed it until they reached Durin's Tower in the living rock of Zirakzigil, the pinnacle of the Silvertine above the clouds. There they fought, until at last Gandalf threw down his enemy, and the Balrog broke the mountain-side as it fell. Then darkness took Gandalf, and he passed away. His body lay on the peak. The entire battle, from the confrontation on the Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm to the mutual demise of the Balrog and Gandalf, had taken ten days.\nResurrection\nThen darkness took me, and I strayed out of thought and time, and I wandered far on roads that I will not tell... Naked I was sent back \u2013 for a brief time, until my task is done. And naked I lay upon the mountain-top. \u2026 There I lay staring upward, while the stars wheeled over, and each day was as long as a life-age of the earth.\u2014The Lord of the Rings, Vol. II: The Two Towers, Book Three, Ch. V: \"The White Rider\"\nGandalf riding Shadowfax, by Ralph Damiani\nBut Gandalf's spirit did not depart Middle-earth forever at this time. As the only one of the five Istari to stay true to his errand, Ol\u00f3rin/Gandalf was sent back to mortal lands by Eru, and he became Gandalf once again. Yet, as he was now the sole emissary of the Valar to Middle-earth, he was granted the power to \"reveal\" more of his inner Maiar strength. This naked power that lay within him was seldom used during the remainder of his time in Middle-earth, as his mission was essentially the same: to support and succor those who opposed Sauron. Nevertheless, when Gandalf's wrath was kindled his \"unveiled\" strength was such that few of Sauron's servants could withstand him.\nThree days later he was found by the windlord Gwaihir, Lord of the Eagles, who had been sent by Galadriel to find him. Gandalf was carried to Caras Galadhon in Lothl\u00f3rien, where he was healed, given a new staff, and clothed in white, and thus became Gandalf the White. He soon learned that Frodo and Sam had left the Fellowship and were attempting the quest of Mount Doom without the others, and was greatly gladdened to hear that Sam had accompanied Frodo.\nWar in Rohan\nGandalf confronting Th\u00e9oden, controlled by Saruman\nAs Frodo was beyond his assistance now, Gandalf promptly went south to Fangorn Forest, where he met the Three Hunters, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, and gave them messages from Galadriel. Then he called forth Shadowfax, and rode with them to Edoras. There he found that Saruman's spy Gr\u00edma Wormtongue had deceived King Th\u00e9oden into hopeless impotence. Gandalf quickly deposed Wormtongue and encouraged Th\u00e9oden to ride west to war against Saruman. Gandalf by now was keenly aware that the great war to end the age was beginning; if Isengard conquered Rohan then Gondor would be crushed between the Enemy's pincers.[30][31]\nKeep well the Lord of the Mark, till I return. Await me at Helm's Gate. Farewell!\u2014Gandalf to Aragorn and \u00c9omer and the men of the king's household\nGandalf the White returns, at Helm's Deep\nAt Gandalf's encouragement, King Th\u00e9oden went west to the Hornburg where he was quickly besieged; Gandalf then searched for Erkenbrand and the scattered forces of the Westfold, which he later found and led to the Deep, thus breaking the siege. Meanwhile, the Ents (along with, and persuaded by, the Hobbits Merry and Pippin) moved against Saruman and sent Huorns against the Orcs, resulting in the utter ruin of the outer walls of Isengard and the complete annihilation of Saruman's Orcs.\nThen I gave [Saruman] a last choice and a fair one: to renounce both Mordor and his private schemes, and make amends by helping us in our need. \u2014Gandalf to Merry, The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, Book Three, Chapter X: \"The Voice of Saruman\"\nAfter the battle, Gandalf went to Orthanc with Th\u00e9oden, Aragorn, and a small group to confront Saruman. There Saruman attempted to sway Gandalf to his side one more time, but Gandalf remained undaunted, recalling Saruman's actions as the \"jailor of Mordor\" during his last visit to Isengard. Reminding Saruman that he had betrayed both \"[his] neighbors\" and \"[his] new master\", Gandalf offered him a chance of redemption, if Saruman came down and surrendered his staff and the keys of Orthanc as a pledge. The Wizard, however, squandered this chance with contempt.  Gandalf then broke Saruman's staff and expelled him from both the Istari's ranks and the White Council. As Saruman crawled back into Orthanc, Gr\u00edma, unsure whether he hated Saruman or Gandalf more, threw down the tower's palant\u00edr and hit neither; the Seeing Stone was picked up by Pippin and taken by Gandalf. Gandalf imposed a strict watch on Isengard by the Ents and then advised  Th\u00e9oden to ride to Gondor's defense as soon as possible. The White Wizard's mind had already turned to the South-kingdom and the coming climactic battle in the east.[32]\nSiege of Gondor\nGandalf saves the Osgiliath force\nAs a 'reward' for Pippin, who had foolishly gazed into a palant\u00edr, Gandalf took the Hobbit with him to Minas Tirith, the last bastion of the west. Soon after arriving, Gandalf confronted Denethor II, the Ruling Steward, and learned that he was near despair over the death of his eldest son, Boromir. Pippin entered the Steward's service in payment of the debt that he and Merry owed, the death of Boromir. Ostensibly they were allies, but the Steward treated Gandalf with scorn and suspicion. When Faramir, the Steward's younger son, returned from Osgiliath and was attacked by Nazg\u00fbl, Gandalf upon Shadowfax drove them away by revealing the power within him; later Faramir told him that Frodo and Sam were still alive and headed towards Mordor.\nMinas Tirith was soon besieged by a vast force from Mordor, led by the Witch-king of Angmar. Faramir having received a wound from a poisoned dart in the retreat from Osgiliath, lay near death inside the Tower. Still, Gandalf encouraged the men of Minas Tirith to have hope, and dispelled the fear of the Ringwraiths by his very presence. But Sauron's catapults hurled flaming bolts upon the city; soon the first circle of the city burned unchecked. Denethor now lost all heart as the city burned and his only remaining son hovered near death; he abandoned his leadership of the city. Gandalf then took it upon himself to direct the defense in cooperation with Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth. When the gigantic ram Grond destroyed Minas Tirith's Great Gate, Gandalf placed himself alone at the ruined gateway. The Witch-king then appeared in the midst of the blasted gate upon a black horse and threatened Gandalf with death; but Gandalf did not move \u2014 seated upon Shadowfax he defied the mightiest of Sauron's minions. However, the stand-off ended inconclusively, as the morning arrived along with the host of the Rohirrim. Hearing the horns of the Riders of Rohan, the Witch-king departed.\nBut Gandalf did not pursue his foe, for Pippin brought him news that Denethor was about to commit suicide in the Houses of the Dead, burning himself and his son Faramir on a pyre like the heathen Kings of old. Gandalf rushed to stop this madness and was able to save Faramir, but not Denethor, whose despair and grief had overcome his mind. Gandalf also learned how it was that Denethor's will had been broken: Denethor clutched a palant\u00edr in his hands as he burned. Clearly Denethor had been using the stone's special properties for some time \u2014 extending his vision far beyond those of men's eyes, but also wrestling in thought with Sauron. And even though Sauron could not completely overwhelm Denethor's mind, his courage was daunted by knowledge of the vast might of Mordor. Thus the shadow entered into the capital of Gondor.\nNevertheless, and against all hope, the siege was broken. \u00c9owyn of Rohan and the hobbit Merry defeated the Witch-king, whose last wail was heard by many as he was reduced to impotence. Soon after, Aragorn arrived with a large valour of Men from the southern fiefs upon a captured Corsair fleet from Umbar. The forces of the men of the west then utterly defeated Sauron's attack against Minas Tirith, relieving the city and killing virtually all of the invaders. Gandalf's carefully laid plans and words of wisdom, along with acts of heroism not seen since the elder days, had defeated Sauron's first move.\nFall of Sauron\nIn Minas Tirith, Gandalf was selected by Aragorn, Imrahil, and \u00c9omer (the Captains of the West) to be their leader in the coming final battles. This would be the culmination of Gandalf's efforts in Middle-earth. Fully aware that the west would stand or fall on the outcome of Frodo's mission, he advised the lords to launch an attack against the Morannon, thereby drawing Sauron's eye away from Frodo's likely location. This plan surely would result in a catastrophic loss for the outnumbered army, but it gave Frodo a chance to achieve the quest of Mount Doom.\nGandalf in the final battle at the Black Gate of Mordor\nLed by Gandalf and Aragorn, the Army of the West crossed the Anduin and marched north, pausing occasionally to announce their coming and to dispatch small numbers of men to lesser tasks. Upon arriving at the Black Gate, the forces halted and prepared for battle. As they ordered their companies, the foul Mouth of Sauron rode forth to parley with them; he revealed Frodo's Mithril Coat and Sam's Barrow-blade and implied that their owner was captured and tortured. The emissary of Sauron then proposed that the forces of the west surrender; Gandalf however was undaunted, and, seizing his friend's belongings, rejected Sauron's offer. In shock, the Mouth of Sauron turned back towards the Black Gate, which slowly opened to reveal a vast army of Orcs and Trolls advancing on the lords of the west. Sauron's trap was sprung.\nYet Sauron himself became the victim of Gandalf's trap. Unbeknownst to all, Frodo and Sam had succeeded in scaling Mount Doom and even as the Battle of the Black Gate began Frodo stood at the Cracks of Doom. But the power and lure of the Ring finally overcame his will and he placed the Ring upon his finger, claiming it as his own. Immediately the Nazg\u00fbl were summoned by their lord, as he in terror realized his blunder: his enemies intended to destroy his Ring.\nGandalf with Gwaihir rescues Frodo and Sam\nBut Gandalf's foresight proved accurate again as the creature Gollum, who had been doggedly following the Ring-bearer, seized the Ring from Frodo, and, while celebrating his reunion with \"his precious,\" unwittingly fell into the fires of Orodruin. The Ring was unmade as the fiery mountain erupted. The tower of Barad-d\u00fbr, the Black Gate and the Towers of the Teeth began to collapse, their foundations crumbling, the Ring-wraiths burned out like shooting stars, and Sauron was reduced to a mere shadow of malice, never to torment the world again. With Sauron gone, his forces scattered like frightened insects; the Men of the West now set upon them with fury. Gandalf announced the success of the Ring-bearer and the end of Sauron; the quest had been fulfilled. Seeing that victory was achieved, Gandalf then mounted on Gwaihir the Eagle for a third time, and set out to see if Frodo and Samwise had survived the tumults of Mount Doom. To his great relief, the two were found on the slopes of Orodruin, clinging to life amid the volcanic eruptions. The great quest was over.\nFinal deeds\nIn Minas Tirith, Gandalf and the remaining members of the Fellowship reunited. At the coronation of King Elessar, Gandalf (at Aragorn's request) set the crown upon the King's head, and declared \"Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the Valar endure!\". Thus Gandalf ushered in the new age of Men. Not long after Gandalf led Aragorn to a high hallow on the upper slopes of Mindolluin and there they found a sapling of the White Tree of Gondor, a sign of the renewal that was to come.\nAfter the coronation and wedding of Aragorn to Arwen, Gandalf left with the rest of the remaining Fellowship on the journey home. For Gandalf, it was his last long journey in Middle-earth. His errand had been fulfilled; Sauron had been defeated. He said farewell to his friends one by one until at last only the four Hobbits remained at his side. At the borders of the Shire he, too, turned away. He left the Hobbits to settle with the Shire, for the shattered pieces of evil still remaining in the world were no longer his concern, and went to talk to \"moss gatherer\" Tom Bombadil.\nDeparting from Middle-earth\nWhat Gandalf did during the next two years is unknown; it is possible that his \"long talk\" with Bombadil was just that. At any rate, on September 29 3021, he met Frodo at the Grey Havens ready to take a White Ship over the sea to Aman. He wore Narya openly on his finger, and Shadowfax was beside him (perhaps even to take ship with him). His mission was over, and his homecoming after more than 2000 years was nigh. He bade farewell to Samwise, Merry, and Pippin (the latter two of whom he had forewarned of the passage), then boarded the ship beside Frodo, Bilbo, Elrond, and was never seen again in Middle-earth.[33]\nThe ship passed west upon the sea, and then took the hidden straight path to Valinor: Gandalf became Ol\u00f3rin once more. There, presumably, he dwells still in the gardens of Irmo. Ol\u00f3rin, the wisest of the Maiar and the sole Istar to remain true to his mission, had successfully kindled the hearts of the free people in Middle-earth to overcome the evil of their time. In a large way, it was his victory.",

        "biography": "Origin\nSaruman was originally a powerful Maia of Aul\u00eb the Smith named Curumo (later in Sindarin, Curun\u00edr).[3] From the beginning, he was much like Sauron,[4] being ambitious and cunning, and desiring order.\nAs Tarindor, Saruman was among the Five Guardians who were sent to reinforce Melian and the already active Guardians in protecting the newly-awakened Elves from Melkor's emissaries.\nThird Age\nDepiction of Saruman as the Maia Curumo, before leaving Valinor\nIn Valinor, the land of the Valar, a council was called by Manw\u00eb, Eru's regent, shortly after Sauron's defeat by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men at the end of the Second Age. Though the Dark Lord was overthrown, he had not been effectively vanquished. Late in the Third Age, his Shadow began to fall upon Middle-earth a second time. It was decided to send five emissaries to Middle-earth. These should be \"mighty, peers of Sauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh,\" as they were intended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron. The Wizards were forbidden, however, from matching the Dark Lord in power and fear, or trying to dominate the Free Peoples.[1]\nCurumo was one of those who volunteered, whereas the last one, Ol\u00f3rin, (later known as \"Gandalf\") was commanded by Manw\u00eb to go too. It was from this point that Curumo began to be jealous of Ol\u00f3rin, due to Varda's decision to send Ol\u00f3rin not as the third Istar, but as the second. He also was charged to take Aiwendil (later called \"Radagast\") to please Yavanna, which Curumo did not wish to do, and this led to contempt for the latter Wizard. The others who were chosen were Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards). Curumo then was appointed overall leader of the group.[1]\n\nArrival in Middle-earth\nThe arrival of the Istari in Middle-earth\nThe Five Wizards arrived separately at the Grey Havens in the west of Eriador around the year TA 1000. Curumo appeared first, but apparently neglected to take Aiwendil with him; Aiwendil came later alongside Ol\u00f3rin.[5] Only the keeper of the havens, C\u00edrdan the Shipwright, knew Curumo's nature and purpose. Curumo would later discover that C\u00edrdan had given Narya, the Red Ring, to Ol\u00f3rin upon their first landing in Middle-earth. Even though Curumo was recognized as the head of the order while Ol\u00f3rin was not, C\u00edrdan had divined Ol\u00f3rin as the wisest and greatest of the Istari. Curumo's jealousy of Ol\u00f3rin grew from these events, perhaps because he feared that he would eventually supplant him as chief of the Wizards.\nTo the Elves, Curumo became known as Curun\u00edr, whereas Men called him Saruman, the name by which he was afterwards remembered. The White Messenger and the two Blue Wizards went into the east of Middle-earth. After one and a half millennia, Saruman returned to the west, just as Sauron's power was growing again at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood.\nSaruman portrayed by Sir Christopher Lee\nThe White Council\nYet he is great among the Wise. He is the chief of my order and the head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it, and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small, is his province. \u2014 Gandalf the Grey\nWhen the White Council was formed around the year 2463 of the Third Age in order to counter Sauron, Saruman was appointed its leader, though Galadriel wanted Gandalf in this position. Saruman refused to step down due to his pride, while Gandalf had declined; the White Messenger, though, continued to resent the Grey Pilgrim. He also had an intense dislike for Radagast, whom he dismissed as a fool.\nAt this point Saruman had begun to sense the resurgence of Sauron. This was also the same year that Sauron's One Ring was taken by the Stoor Sm\u00e9agol (later called Gollum), who disappeared with it into the Misty Mountains for hundreds of years. The White Wizard's extensive research, especially into Ring-lore, had led him to admire the Dark Lord and he fell into the folly of imitating him. Saruman believed he could be the ruler of Middle-earth, in Sauron's likeness, and \"have his own will by force\".[1]\nIt was during the meetings of the White Council that Saruman first noted Gandalf's interest in Hobbits and the Shire, and believing that all his deeds related to some as yet undisclosed plan of his for self-enhancement, the White Wizard himself began keeping a closer watch on the Grey Pilgrim and sent spies to the Shire to report on all his movements. At first, he himself visited it secretly but stopped when he realized that its inhabitants had noticed him. Amongst the purposes of his visits was to procure some of the halflings' Pipe-weed, since in secret imitation of Gandalf (and for which he publicly belittled him) Saruman had begun to smoke.\nAt Isengard\nSoon after he took up his abode in Isengard. For this, Beren, Steward of Gondor, gave him leave, for Gondor still claimed Isengard as a fortress of its realm, and not part of Rohan. Beren also gave into Saruman's keeping the keys of Orthanc. That tower no enemy had been able to harm or to enter. In this way Saruman began to behave as a lord of Men; for at first he held Isengard as a lieutenant of the Steward and warden of the tower. But Fr\u00e9al\u00e1f was as glad as Beren to have this so, and to know that Isengard was in the hands of a strong friend. A friend he long seemed, and maybe in the beginning he was one in truth.\u2014The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A \"The House of Eorl\"\nSaruman, as depicted by John Howe\nIn the year TA 2759, Saruman came to the crowning of Fr\u00e9al\u00e1f Hildeson in Rohan, \"bringing gifts\" and wooing him with flattery. With the permission of both the Steward of Gondor, Beren, and the King of Rohan, Fr\u00e9al\u00e1f, Saruman settled in Orthanc at Isengard as both \"warden of the tower\" and representative of Minas Tirith. Though recognized as an ally by both the Rohirrim and the Gondorians, the Wizard's main goal all along had been to eventually claim the stronghold as his own seat of power.[6] As he had hoped, Saruman also found one of the remaining palant\u00edri in Orthanc, but deceptively concealed his discovery from the rest of the White Council.\nIn TA 2850, Gandalf entered Dol Guldur and confirmed that the evil presence within was indeed Sauron. Still desiring the One Ring but also desiring to hide his true motives, Saruman advised the White Council against attacking Dol Guldur by deceiving them into believing that the One Ring would never be found. The Grey Pilgrim would later remark that it was at this meeting that he first began to suspect that the White Wizard desired to attain the One Ring. Saruman's real intention was to allow Sauron to build up his strength, so that the Ring would reveal itself and he could claim it first, so he was willing to let Sauron be for the time being.\nConcealing his contempt, Saruman persuaded Radagast to teach him how to tame birds and beasts; these he used as spies for his own purposes, unbeknownst to the Brown Wizard.[7] He later found that the Enemy had more knowledge of the possible location of the One Ring than he expected. Therefore, in TA 2941, Saruman finally agreed to an assault upon Dol Guldur. The attack was successful, and by the devices of the White Wizard, the Dark Lord was driven from the fortress.\nAt the last meeting of the White Council in TA 2953, Saruman claimed that the Ring had been \"passed down Anduin to the Sea\". He then ceased all cooperation with the Wise, taking Isengard for his own and fortifying it. Surrounding himself with \"all who hated Gondor and Rohan\" (i.e. Northern Orcs from the Misty Mountains, Dunlendings and other evil things), Saruman troubled the borders of the Rohirrim during the reign of Thengel and began building his own army. Around TA 2990, Saruman started the \"special breeding\" of Orcs at Isengard and, as Morgoth and Sauron had done before him, crossbred Orcs with Men to make Half-orcs,[4] and eventually his own Uruk-hai, both of which could endure the sunlight.\nJailor of Mordor\nA new power is rising. Against it the old allies and policies will not avail us at all. There is no hope left in Elves or dying N\u00famenor. This then is one choice before you, before us. We may join with that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There is hope that way. Its victory is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it.\u2014Saruman, speaking to Gandalf - The Fellowship of the Ring, \"The Council of Elrond\"\nSaruman the White, by 1oshuart\nSoon enough, Sauron, who had returned to Mordor, used the Ithil-stone to establish contact with Saruman's Orthanc-stone. Daunted with threats and lured with promises of power,[8] Saruman submitted to Sauron. Betraying the White Council, the Wizard became one of the Dark Lord's chief agents, desiring or no longer opposing his victory. Though the Wise were suspicious of Saruman's designs concerning the Ring, they were unaware that he was now \"an ally, or servant, of Sauron\", and traitor to them.[9] But Saruman was, in truth, a faithless vassal, who coveted the Ring for himself. The fallen Wizard's endgame was to usurp his \"new master\"[2] as Lord of the Rings over Middle-earth. If that gamble failed, Saruman reckoned that he would be the right-hand of Sauron, or rather the true power behind his throne.[10] The Wizard failed to understand that he was little more than the Dark Lord's puppet and would have ultimately been cast aside;[11] Sauron knew, or guessed, Saruman's thoughts \"even without the aid of palant\u00edri or of spies\".[4]\n\"Saruman of Many Colors\", by TolmanCotton of DeviantArt\nWorking under orders from Mordor and also eager to expand his own dominion, the  Wizard plotted to \"deliver\" Rohan to his \"dark master\".[2] Aided by his Orcs, Saruman slowly turned Nan Curun\u00edr into \"a child's model or a slave's flattery\" of Mordor:[12] trees were cut down and replaced by caverns filled with forges, furnaces and other machines. Around TA 3000, Saruman sent many of his Uruk-hai to join the Northern Orcs and the Mordor-orcs in raiding the eastern villages of Rohan. To further weaken the kingdom, Saruman bought Gr\u00edma Wormtongue, Th\u00e9oden's counselor, with the promise of \u00c9owyn's hand by TA 3014 and used him as a mole in the royal court to sap the king's strength with deceitful advice and poisons. Suspecting a potential connection between the Ring and the Shire (based mostly on Gandalf's interest there), Saruman instructed his agents to infiltrate the Shire and keep tabs on the comings and goings of any important Hobbits. His dealings with Pipe-weed had also earned him allies among the Sackville-Baggins and Bracegirdle families, who owned many plantations. Saruman also used his agents in Eriador to keep watch on the D\u00fanedain protecting the Shire, as well as to mislead Sauron's more trustworthy informants.[11] Further trying to emulate his master, the Wizard crafted his own lesser ring and similarly styled himself as \"Ring-maker\".[10]\nUsing the kind-hearted Radagast as an unwitting pawn, Saruman summoned Gandalf to Isengard; so it was that upon Gandalf's arrival, Saruman revealed his betrayal and true intentions, shedding the title of Saruman the White in favour of Saruman of Many Colours. He announced his desire to rule Middle-earth as Sauron's right-hand, or to supplant him using the Ring; he then demanded that the Grey Pilgrim submit to him or to his master. Saruman stated that siding with Sauron would be a wise decision. Gandalf refused both choices, for which Saruman imprisoned him atop Orthanc. This way, Saruman thought he would force Gandalf into revealing the Ring's whereabouts,[10] before sending him as captive to Sauron in Mordor;[2]  Saruman had even revealed to Sauron he \"had got as his prisoner Gandalf\".[11] But Gandalf later escaped with help from Gwaihir the Windlord, one of the Great Eagles, and made Saruman's treachery known to the rest of the Free Peoples at the Council of Elrond.[10]\nBeginning of the End\nWe will have peace, when you and all your works have perished--and the works of your dark master to whom you would deliver us. You are a liar, Saruman, and a corrupter of men's hearts. You hold out your hand to me, and I perceive only a finger of the claw of Mordor. Cruel and cold! Even if your war on me was just--as it was not, for were you ten times as wise you would have no right to rule me and mine for your own profit as you desired--even so, what will you say of your torches in Westfold and the children that lie dead there?\u2014Th\u00e9oden, The Two Towers, \"The Voice of Saruman\"\nSaruman making a bomb in his tower, Orthanc\nBy one account, the Nazg\u00fbl came two days after Gandalf's escape, and Saruman used his voice to persuade the Morgul Lord that he did not know the Ring's location. The Wizard boasted that, had he known, he would have already claimed the Ring and the Nine would have submitted to him. Saruman then told them that Gandalf knew, and that they should seek him nearby. Hearing this, the Nazg\u00fbl went back on the main road and instead found Gr\u00edma, on his way to tell Saruman that Gandalf had been to Edoras. Fearing for his life, Wormtongue revealed that the corrupted Wizard had withheld information and told the Ringwraiths how to reach the Shire.\nBy another account, Saruman still had Gandalf as a prisoner when the Nazg\u00fbl arrived. The Wizard assured the Ringwraiths that he would obtain the Shire's whereabouts from the Grey Pilgrim or hand him over to them. Daunted by the \"full horror of service to Mordor\", Saruman had actually been about to beg Gandalf for forgiveness and help, only to find him gone. Nonetheless, he pretended that the Grey Pilgrim was still there and had just given up the location of the Shire. Saruman believed he now had enough time to try seize the Ring, while still feigning allegiance to Sauron. But the Ringwraiths soon learned that the Wizard knew far more than he had shared with them. On their way to the Shire, the Nazg\u00fbl encountered one of Saruman's agents in Eriador, from whom they got detailed maps of the Shire. They sent the spy to Bree after warning him that he was now in the service of Mordor not Isengard; the spy in question was the ill-favored Dunlending at the The Prancing Pony.[11]\nCommanded by Sauron, Saruman moved against Th\u00e9oden to keep Rohan from riding to Gondor's aid. With Gr\u00edma preventing any military mobilization within the kingdom, Saruman sent large raiding forces to wreak havoc in the Westfold of Rohan. The only true obstacles to his invasion were Th\u00e9oden's son and nephew, Th\u00e9odred and \u00c9omer respectively. As Wormtongue had failed to turn the two men against each other,  the White Wizard tasked his servants to slay the king's heir at all costs. Per this special order, the warriors of Isengard engaged the defenders of Rohan at the Fords of Isen; the First Battle at the Fords of Isen ended in the death of Th\u00e9odred followed by the retreat of Saruman's hordes. At the same time, the Wizard also betrayed his master: he sent trusted warbands to hunt down the Fellowship and capture the Ring-bearer. Saruman's scouts, led by Ugl\u00fak, ambushed the company at Amon Hen, where they took Pippin and Merry captive, while also shooting Boromir \"with many black-feathered arrows\" when he tried to defend the Hobbits. Slowed on their way back to Isengard by conflict with Mordor-orcs loyal to Sauron, the Isengarders were slain on the eaves of Fangorn by Rohirrim led by \u00c9omer. Gimli believed he had glimpsed Saruman at the site of the skirmish, presumably having hastened to claim the Ring from the Hobbits.\nSaruman in his tower.\nThe Wizard's position was becoming dangerously isolated: he lacked the Ring, his neighbors he had \"made [his] enemies\" and he had also \"cheated [his] new master\". Believing he might yet claim lordship over Rohan and regain Sauron's favor by delivering the Rohirrim to him,[2] Saruman intensified his efforts against Th\u00e9oden. Although Gr\u00edma Wormtongue had been ousted as an agent of the Enemy, Rohan had been weakened, allowing Saruman to marshal his full might and unleash his Uruk-hai hordes upon the Rohirrim people at Helm's Deep. Though it initially held the upper hand, Saruman's army was vanquished in the Battle of the Hornburg, its ranks broken by Gandalf's reinforcements. Meanwhile, the Wizard also found his own stronghold under assault. The Ents led by Treebeard besieged Isengard, seeking vengeance for incursions by Orc axemen into Fangorn. These two confrontations led to the end of Saruman's reign of terror in the West, while also costing Sauron a valuable, albeit duplicitous, vassal.\nPower destroyed\nYour servants are destroyed and scattered; your neighbours you have made your enemies; and you have cheated your new master, or tried to do so. When his eye turns hither, it will be the red eye of wrath. But when I say 'free', I mean 'free': free from bond, of chain or command: to go where you will, even, even to Mordor, Saruman, if you desire. But you will first surrender to me the Key of Orthanc, and your staff. They shall be pledges of your conduct, to be returned later, if you merit them.\u2014Gandalf the White, The Two Towers, \"The Voice of Saruman\"\nSaruman looks down upon Gandalf from the pinnacle of Orthanc\nFollowing the Ents' destruction of Isengard, Saruman found himself confined to Orthanc and his servants scattered or killed. After the arrival of Th\u00e9oden, Gandalf, Aragorn, and the remaining members of the Fellowship, Saruman confronted them from the balcony of Orthanc. \nHe made one final unsuccessful attempt to bring Th\u00e9oden under his sway, offering him counsel and friendship. The king refused, recognizing him as a pawn of Sauron and demanding justice for the atrocities Saruman had committed against the Rohirrim. Gandalf offered Saruman a chance at redemption, which involved surrendering his staff and the Key of Orthanc as a pledge, in exchange for freedom to head wherever he pleased - even to Mordor. Saruman had a moment of doubt but in the end pride, envy, fear and hate won over and he refused the chance of redemption.[2] Moreover, he did not want to \"appear a rebel\" to his master and suffer his wrath.[8]\nSaruman's staff broken by Gandalf\nGandalf, who had returned from death to accomplish the mission Saruman did not, expelled the turncoat from the ranks of the Istari and the White Council and broke his staff. Saruman also lost the palant\u00edr of Orthanc when Gr\u00edma threw it off a balcony, undecided about which he hated more, Saruman or Gandalf, and hitting neither.[2] With no captive to send nor palant\u00edr to \"answer the summons\", Saruman had no means of appeasing Sauron. He thus locked himself in Orthanc, living in terror of both the Free Peoples and his master.[8]\n\nFinal fall\nLeft out of the final stages of the War of the Ring, Saruman eventually managed to persuade the Ents holding him captive to let him and his servant Gr\u00edma leave Isengard after he handed to them the Key of Orthanc. He went thence to the Shire, which his ally Lotho Sackville-Baggins had brought under control. Powerless to directly avenge himself on Gandalf, Saruman instead resolved to hurt the Hobbits of whom Gandalf was so fond. To this end, he spent his final days as a criminal master in Hobbiton known as Sharkey (from the Orkish shark\u00fb, meaning \"old man\"), disposing of Lotho Sackville-Baggins through Gr\u00edma. But his reign of terror came to an end with his overthrow in the Battle of Bywater, after which Frodo confronted Saruman and exiled him from the Shire. Saruman agreed to leave. However, when Frodo attempts to convince Gr\u00edma that he no longer needs to serve Saruman, Saruman exposes Grima's murder of Lotho Sackville-Baggins. Gr\u00edma argued that Saruman made him do that, but Saruman mocked him and slapped him down. As Saruman began to walk, a now rageful Gr\u00edma, who finally had enough of Saruman's physical and verbal abuse, slit his throat from behind with a dagger, leading to the end of the traitorous and corrupted Wizard.\nAfter Saruman's departure from Orthanc, King Elessar entered the tower with the intent of re-ordering it. Inside, Elessar's men found many treasures that Saruman had stolen from Rohan. The original Elendilmir, presumed lost forever when Isildur perished in the Gladden Fields, was also found, as well as a golden chain presumed to have once borne the One Ring. It was suspected that, during his search for the Ring near the Anduin, Saruman had discovered the remains of Isildur and burnt them out of scorn, keeping only his possessions.\nFate\nAs a Maia, Saruman could not really die. His spirit separated from his body much like Sauron's did after the fall of N\u00famenor. As an incorporeal spirit, he should have been called to the Halls of Mandos, but it is implied that he was barred from returning. It is indicated that his spirit was left naked, powerless and wandering, never to return to Middle-earth:\nWhereas Curunir was cast down, and utterly humbled, and perished at last by the hand of an oppressed slave; and his spirit went whither-soever it was doomed to go, and to Middle-earth, whether naked or embodied, came never back.\u2014Saruman's fate",

        "biography": "Origin\n\"Nothing is evil in the beginning. Even Sauron was not so.\"\n\u2014The Fellowship of the Ring, \"The Council of Elrond\"\nSauron's original name was Mairon. He was the mightiest Maia of the Vala Aul\u00eb the Smith, and learned much from Aul\u00eb of smithing and handiwork, becoming a great craftsman and \"mighty in the lore of\" Aul\u00eb's people.[2] He was among the most powerful Maiar.\n\"Mairon\", as depicted by Elena Kukanova.\nIn the Days before days, Mairon was as Eru had created him: good and noble. His greatest virtue was his love of order and perfection, and dislike of anything wasteful. However, this would also prove to be the cause of his betrayal and downfall, as Mairon saw in Melkor the will and power that would help him achieve his personal ends quicker than if he pursued them alone. However, while Melkor wanted to either control or destroy Middle-earth itself, Mairon's desire was to dominate the minds and wills of its creatures for what he perceived to be their own benefit. To see his marvelous designs through, Mairon sought to increase his innate power, so he betrayed the Valar and joined Melkor, soon becoming his chief agent.\nAfter allying himself with Melkor, Mairon feigned loyalty to the Valar, which allowed him to secretly inform his master of his dealings with them. When Melkor established his strongholds in Middle-earth, Mairon left Valinor and openly declared his allegiance, becoming a recognized foe of the Valar.\nFirst Age\n\"In all the deeds of Melkor the Morgoth upon Arda, in his vast works and in the deceits of his cunning, Sauron had a part, and was only less evil than his master in that for long he served another and not himself.\"\n\u2014The Silmarillion, Valaquenta, \"Of the Enemies\"\nAs Melkor's lieutenant, Sauron commanded the fortress of Angband.[3] It was with Sauron's aid that Melkor was able to breed Orcs, in mockery of the Children of Il\u00favatar.[4] At the beginning of the Battle of the Powers, Sauron feigned a resistance against the Valar at Angband, thus allowing Melkor to muster forces at Utumno unnoticed.[5] After both Angband and Utumno were sacked and Melkor captured, Sauron was not found; in their haste to both capture the Dark Lord and remove him from Middle-earth, the Valar overlooked Sauron's escape.[3]\nSauron \"controlled things\" in Melkor's absence:[6] Angband's reconstruction began, and the Orcs there multiplied under his command.[7] Possibly aware of the Great March, Sauron may have harried the Elves on their journey, directing Melkor's servants abroad or affecting the weather.[8] The Sindar Elves in Beleriand called him Gorthaur, meaning \"dread abomination\",[9] while others of the Eldar had named him Sauron, meaning \"the abhorred\" or \"the abominable\" (a mockery of his original name). Under Sauron's regency, Angband was almost ready by YT 1495,[6] with Orc armies already prepared by him when Morgoth (Melkor) returned.[7]\nSauron as Morgoth's lieutenant in the First Age, by Eric Faure-Brac\nTowards the end of the First Age, the \u00d1oldor Elves left the Blessed Realm of Valinor in the Utter West (against the counsel of the Valar) in order to wage war on Morgoth following his theft of the Silmarils of F\u00ebanor, enchanted gems that glowed with light from the now-destroyed Trees of Valinor. In that war, Sauron was counted as the \"greatest of [Morgoth's] servants that have names\" and was soon feared as a lord of phantoms and dreadful beasts, a shape-shifter and sorcerer.\nWhen Morgoth left Angband much later to corrupt the newly awakened Atani (Men), Sauron directed the war against the Elves.[10] Commanding \"a host of Balrogs\" by one account,[11] he seized the Elvish isle of Tol Sirion from its warden, Orodreth, and turned it into Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the Isle of werewolves.[12] There he established himself as the Lord of werewolves, with both Draugluin, sire of the werewolves, and Thuringwethil, a Vampire herald, at his side.\nAfter the Dagor Bragollach in FA 456, Sauron was bidden by Morgoth to destroy Barahir, ally of Finrod, King of Nargothrond; Sauron ensnared Gorlim, who was captured by his hunters, and interrogated him about the outlaw-lord's location. Gorlim refused to tell them anything, even under torture, until Sauron himself came forth and bartered with the man. Gorlim asked for his wife Eilinel, whom he thought captured. Thus, Sauron agreed and Gorlim yielded the information. However, Morgoth's agent then revealed that Eilinel was dead, and he put Gorlim to death afterward. Sauron then sent Gorgol the Butcher's horde to slay Barahir and his company. Barahir's son, Beren, evaded this fate and after news of his deeds reached Morgoth, Sauron at the helm of an army of Orcs, werewolves and other fell beasts started hunting him.\nIn the Quest for the Silmaril, Beren and Finrod were captured by Sauron when they tried to sneak past Tol-in-Gaurgoth in Orc disguises. Sauron then defeated Finrod in a duel with songs of power, as told in The Lay of Leithian. Striping them of their stolen garb, he cast them into the dungeons where Werewolves devoured their companions; Morgoth's vassal hoped to terrify them into revealing their quest. When one of Sauron's werewolves came to attack Beren, Finrod wrestled with and killed it, but died soon after of his injuries.\nSauron, as a werewolf, defeated by Huan - by Ted Nasmith\nSoon afterward, L\u00fathien and Huan the wolfhound arrived at the bridge of Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Sauron sent his servants to capture L\u00fathien, but all were slain by Huan, including Draugluin, but he fled and told his master that Huan was there. Sauron was aware of the prophecy that stated that Huan could not be slain save by the greatest wolf that had ever lived. As such, Sauron took the form of a werewolf and resolved to kill Huan and capture L\u00fathien. His form was so monstrous that as he charged down the bridge even Huan was forced to spring aside. But L\u00fathien possessed the ability to cast spells of sleep, and had one such spell active upon her when Sauron attacked. Sauron was momentarily impacted by the spell as he lunged at her, and Huan took advantage of this brief distraction to leap upon Sauron.\nIn the end Huan took Sauron by the throat and subdued him, and though Sauron attempted to shapeshift into a serpent and escape, Huan's grip upon his throat was too strong. L\u00fathien demanded then that Sauron yield to her the tower and the isle. She knew that Huan could not kill Sauron; as a Maia he was immortal. But she knew as well that Sauron had built up a great deal of power in his corporeal form, and that if Huan destroyed it, that power would be lost. So she mocked him with the possibility of having to flee back to Angband, powerless and without a body, to endure the scorn of Morgoth. Ultimately, Sauron was not willing to endure such shame, and chose to surrender Tol-in-Gaurhoth to her rather than have his flesh destroyed. Huan released him and he fled in the form of a \"vampire\".[13]\n\n\"He repents in fear when the First Enemy is utterly defeated, but in the end does not do as was commanded, return to the judgement of the gods. He lingers in Middle-earth. \"\n\u2014The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, \"Letter 131\"\nAfter his defeat by L\u00fathien, Sauron played little part in the events of the First Age (possibly hiding from Morgoth's scorn or wrath). After his former master was defeated and taken to Valinor in chains at the end of the First Age, Sauron approached the victorious Host of the West and pled with E\u00f6nw\u00eb for mercy. However, E\u00f6nw\u00eb did not have the authority to pardon a being of his own order, and commanded Sauron to return to Aman to be judged by the Valar. It is not known for certain whether Sauron was genuinely repentant, daunted by the Host's victory, or some combination of the two. Regardless however, Sauron's pride and fear ultimately won out and instead of returning to Valinor, he fled and hid in Middle-earth.[14]\nSecond Age\nForging of the One Ring\n\"Very slowly, beginning with fair motives: the reorganising and rehabilitation of the ruin of Middle-earth, 'neglected by the gods', he becomes a reincarnation of evil, and a thing lusting for Complete Power \u2013 and so consumed ever more  fiercely with hate (especially of gods and Elves). \"\n\u2014The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, \"Letter 131\"\nAfter remaining hidden and dormant for five centuries, Sauron began revealing himself once more. At first his wishes were those of a reformer: he fancied that, with \"the Valar (including Melkor) having failed\", he would reorganize and heal Middle-earth. But his pride became boundless and his lust for absolute power, initially only the means to a noble end, became the end itself. He desired to be a god-king and to be worshipped by all rational creatures. Sauron's hatred for the Valar grew, regarding \"the motives of Manw\u00eb as precisely the same as his own\".\n\"A new shadow arises in the East. It is no tyranny of evil Men, as your son believes; but a servant of Morgoth is stirring, and evil things wake again. Each year it gains in strength, for most Men are ripe to its purpose.\"\n\u2014Gil-galad, Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife\nBy SA 1000, he had gathered power and established himself in the land of Mordor, in eastern Middle-earth, and began building the dreaded Barad-d\u00fbr near Mount Doom. He gathered to his service all the Orcs \"scattered far and wide in the Northern world\" were under his dominion,[15][16] as well as Trolls and other creatures from the days of Morgoth; Sauron also gained the allegiance of certain races of Men such as the Easterlings, \"of old corrupted by Morgoth\", and the Haradrim by promising them plunder, wealth and power.\nAnnatar as imagined by Maureval\nAlthough Sauron knew that Men were easier to sway, he sought to bring the Elves into his service, as they were far more powerful than any Men save the N\u00famen\u00f3reans. By about SA 1500, Sauron deceptively put on a fair visage and called himself Annatar, the \"Lord of Gifts\". It is said that as Annatar he assumed the guise of an emissary of the Valar, ironically \"anticipating the Istari\".[17]\nHe befriended the Elf smiths of Eregion including Celebrimbor, a descendant of F\u00ebanor and the greatest living craftsman. Sauron would go on to counsel them in both new forms of metallurgy and magic. Not all the Elves trusted him, particularly Lady Galadriel, Elrond, and Gil-galad, High King of the \u00d1oldor. Some accounts say that he befriended the Elven smiths of Gwaith-i-M\u00edrdain without the knowledge of Galadriel and Celeborn.[17]  In one version of the story, Sauron developed such a strong hold over Gwaith-i-M\u00edrdain that he persuaded them to rebel against Galadriel and Celeborn which drove them to leave Eregion so he could work unopposed.[17] Regardless, the smiths of Eregion gave themselves over to learning from him just as their ancestors had trusted and learned from Morgoth.\nThis is the Master-ring, the One Ring to rule them all. This is the One Ring that he lost many ages ago, to the great weakening of his power. He greatly desires it \u2013 but he must not get it.\u2014Gandalf the Grey, The Lord of the Rings, \"The Shadow of the Past\"\nEventually, Sauron gave the Elven smiths he worked with the knowledge and encouragement to forge magic Rings, which he infused with potent spells without their knowledge. These included the great Rings of Power while he deceitfully forged the One Ring in secret, to rule the Elvish rings. Upon that ring Sauron wrote in Tengwar the Black Speech inscription,\nAsh nazg durbatul\u00fbk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatul\u00fbk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.\nThis translates as:\nOne ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.\nThe One Ring worn by Sauron\nHowever, as soon as he put on his Ring the Elves sensed his treachery, and removed their Rings and hid them. Having raised the fortress of Barad-d\u00fbr in Mordor in SA 1600, Sauron then prepared ninety years for open war; his gathering of armies was opposed by the two \"powerful enemies behind his back\" in the East and South.[18]  The Elves managed to hide the three greatest of the Rings from him, but the other sixteen Rings of Power were either captured by Sauron, destroyed, or lost. To the Dwarves he had given Seven, but to Men he had given Nine, knowing that they would be the easiest to corrupt.\nDespite having given Rings to the greatest of the Dwarven rulers, whatever plans Sauron had devised for the Dwarves would not come to pass. For when Aul\u00eb had crafted the fathers of the Dwarves, he had made them exceedingly sturdy of both mind and body in order to resist the predations, both physical and spiritual, of Morgoth's dark servants. This proved to be exceedingly fortunate for the Dwarves, for the Dwarf-lords who received the Rings did not fade and could not be influenced by Sauron even while he wore the One Ring. However, the Dwarves did not escape Sauron's maleficence unscathed, for the Rings kindled in the hearts of those who possessed them an insatiable lust for gold. Though this would make many of the Dwarven kingdoms exceedingly prosperous for a time, the obsession of the Dwarven ring-bearers with gold would ultimately bring much grief to their race. As Sauron predicted however, all nine of the Men to whom he had given Rings fell under his sway and became the Nazg\u00fbl, his deadliest servants.\nAnnatar, by Soni Alcorn-Hender\nHaving grown \"'greater', effectively\" than Morgoth at the end,[19] Sauron conquered nearly all of Middle-earth, with only Gil-galad's realm of Lindon being safe from his grasp. At his height during the Accursed Years, became known as the Dark Lord to the Free Peoples. However, he had not expected the intervention of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans, scions of the Edain (and partial descendants through Elros, of Beren and L\u00fathien). The armies of the King of N\u00famenor, Tar-Minastir, defeated Sauron's forces in the Battle of the Gwathl\u00f3 in SA 1700. Beaten but not wholly vanquished, Sauron fled back to Mordor with only his bodyguard and began rebuilding his strength over the next centuries.\n\"When [Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n] learned that Sauron had taken the title of King of Kings and Lord of the World, he resolved to put down the 'pretender'.\"\n\u2014The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, \"Letter 131\"\nTowards the end of the Second Age, he was once again powerful enough to raise large armies to attempt to conquer Middle-earth. By this time, he assumed the titles of \"Lord of the Earth\" and \"King of Men\". He once again conquered nearly all of Middle-earth but his harassment of a number of N\u00famenorian settlements along the western coasts brought him to the attention of Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, the most powerful King of N\u00famenor the world had yet seen. Insulted by Sauron's claim to both dominion of the world and the title of \"King of Men\", when Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n considered himself to be the true bearer of that mantle, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n decided to challenge Sauron and force him to swear fealty.\nSauron's fair disguise, by Ralph Damiani\nLife in N\u00famenor\nAr-Pharaz\u00f4n mustered an astounding N\u00famen\u00f3rean army that utterly eclipsed even Sauron's own. In SA 3261, the King landed in Umbar in Middle-earth with his troops and began the trek to Mordor. Sauron's armies were so overmatched that his forces fled from the N\u00famen\u00f3reans as they approached Mordor, and it became quite clear to Sauron that he could not best Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n by force. Thus when Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n sent messengers to Barad-d\u00fbr demanding that Sauron acknowledge the N\u00famen\u00f3rean King's overlordship, Sauron descended from his fortress without any offer of battle and assumed a fair form. His appearance, mannerisms and flattery of the King confused and astonished the N\u00famen\u00f3reans, for rumor of Sauron portrayed him to be anything but what he now presented. However, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n was not so entranced by Sauron's obsequiousness as his generals, and he demanded that Sauron come back to N\u00famenor as a hostage.\nSauron feigned unhappiness at this development but was secretly delighted, for this presented him with an opportunity to destroy the N\u00famen\u00f3reans from within. After only a few short years in N\u00famenor he grew from captive to the King's most trusted adviser, and nearly all the King's court fawned upon him. Drawing on their fear of Death, he deceitfully converted many N\u00famen\u00f3reans to the worship of Morgoth by lying that Morgoth had the power to save them from their mortality. As his power and influence reached its peak, he raised a great Temple for Morgoth in which he performed human sacrifices to the Dark Lord. Finally, he manipulated and deceived Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n to rebel against the Valar and attack Valinor itself and claim it for himself.\n\"[...] and in that hour men called him a god and did all that he would.\"\n\u2014The Silmarillion, Akallab\u00eath\nSauron trying to kill Isildur\nBut here, Eru directly intervened\u2014N\u00famenor was drowned under the sea, and the great navy of N\u00famenor was destroyed and the army that reached Aman was buried under mountains of falling rock and said to be imprisoned in the Caves of the Forgotten. The world was bent, so that thereafter, only Elven-ships could sail into the Utter West. Sauron's body was destroyed, but his spirit was not diminished, and he fled back to Mordor bearing the Ring, where he slowly rebuilt a new body and strength. Hereafter, he lost the ability to assume a fair shape, and ruled now through terror and force. A few Faithful N\u00famen\u00f3reans led by Elendil were saved from the flood, and they founded two Realms in Exile, Arnor and Gondor, in Middle-earth. Ultimately, despite losing his ability to present himself as fair, Sauron had achieved an overwhelming victory in destroying N\u00famenor, which rid him of his most powerful opposition by far in ruling Middle-earth.\nSauron battling Elendil and Gil-galad on Mount Doom's slopes, by Kip Rasmussen\nLoss of the Ring\nAfter learning that Elendil, whom he had especially hated in N\u00famenor, had survived and was ordering a realm on his borders, Sauron made war on Arnor and Gondor. However during his absence in N\u00famenor, Gil-galad, High King of the \u00d1oldor, had significantly increased the power of his own realm. In his haste to prevent Elendil from strengthening his kingdoms, Sauron alerted Gil-galad to his return before his forces were fully prepared. Now aware of Sauron's resurgent threat, Gil-galad allied with Elendil to create the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and together they marched across Middle-earth to attack Sauron. They defeated his armies in the Battle of Dagorlad, and then invaded Mordor and laid siege to Barad-d\u00fbr for seven years. Finally, Sauron himself came forth and dueled with both Elendil and Gil-galad and slew them, shattering Elendil's sword Narsil beneath him as he fell. However, Sauron was so badly wounded in turn that he was not able to stop Isildur, Elendil's son, from cutting the One Ring from his finger with one of Narsil's shards. This destroyed Sauron's physical body, but his spirit endured and fled. Sauron's remaining forces were routed soon afterwards, and Barad-d\u00fbr was leveled to its foundations.\nSauron defeated, after the One Ring was cut from his hand\nThird Age\n\"The Dark Lord is no longer on his throne, but his monsters are not wholly destroyed, and his dreadful servants, slaves of the Ring, endure as shadows among the shadows. \"\n\u2014The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, \"Letter 131\"\nDespite this defeat, the Dark Lord still was not fully vanquished. So long as the Ring existed, Sauron's spirit would always have the ability to endure and take shape once more. For the first millennium of the Third Age he lay in hiding, slowly recovering strength until he regained enough power to direct his old servants, the Nazg\u00fbl and other evil creatures (\"orcs and trolls [...] wargs and werewolves\"),[20] against the Free Peoples.\nThe Necromancer of Dol Guldur\nSauron's appearance as \"the Necromancer\"\nIn TA 1000, Sauron became active once more, occupying the stronghold of Dol Guldur, the Hill of Sorcery, in southern Mirkwood in TA 1050, and working in secret. There, he used the guise of a dreaded sorcerer, called \"the Necromancer\", and the Elves did not yet discern that he was the Dark Lord returned. Around the same time, the Valar sent five Maiar as the Order of Wizards,  to rally the Free Peoples of the World in countering his potential re-emergence. Though Sauron dismissed their presence \"as a mere effort of defeated imperialists\" (seemingly justified in the case of their chief, Saruman), Gandalf arose among them as \"the Enemy of Sauron\".\nWhile the Dark Lord continued to scheme and gather strength, the Nine reappeared in TA 1300, and began steadily assaulting the N\u00famen\u00f3rean kingdoms in exile at his behest, ultimately destroying the North-kingdom of Arnor and gravely weakening the South-kingdom of Gondor. In the same period, foul things that still walked the earth or beneath it were stirred: the Northern Orcs of the Misty Mountains grew bolder in their incursions, while secretly raising strongholds and barring the passes between Eriador and the Vales of Anduin \"according to the plan of their master in Dol Guldur\"; the Dragons laid waste to the Dwarven mansions, consuming three of the Seven Dwarf-rings and claiming the treasure hoards. Guided by the emissaries of the Dark Lord, the Easterlings and other wicked Men also renewed their bitter feud with the Gondorians and Northmen, launching fresh attacks on the western lands.\n\"Before you could get round in the South, you would get into the land of the Necromancer, and even you, Bilbo, won't need me to tell you tales of that black sorcerer. I don't advise you to go anywhere near the places overlooked by his dark tower!\"\n\u2014Gandalf, The Hobbit, \"Queer Lodgings\"\nThe Dark Lord's Ring\nSuspecting that Sauron had indeed returned and that his hand coordinated the steady resurgence of evil, such as the actions of the Nazg\u00fbl, Gandalf infiltrated Dol Guldur in TA 2063 to confirm his suspicion, but the Dark Lord fled eastwards to conceal his identity. This marked the beginning of the Watchful Peace, which ended with Sauron's return to Dol Guldur in TA 2460 with renewed strength. In the same year, the One Ring was finally discovered by the Stoor Sm\u00e9agol and his friend, D\u00e9agol. Sm\u00e9agol murdered D\u00e9agol and took the Ring for himself. Sm\u00e9agol was eventually so changed by the Ring's corruption he was given the name Gollum, ostracized from his people, and dwelt secluded, deep within the Misty Mountains. With Durin's Folk driven out from Khazad-d\u00fbm by Durin's Bane, Sauron began \"to people Moria with his creatures\" around TA 2480; it is quite possible that the Balrog itself \"had been awakened by the malice of Sauron\".\n\n\"Far away here, I wonder if you fully realize the strength of a great Dragon. But that is not all: there is a Shadow growing fast in the world far more terrible. They will help one another.\"\n\u2014Gandalf to Thorin II, Unfinished Tales of N\u00famenor and Middle-earth, \"The Quest of Erebor\"\nFollowing the sack of Erebor, Gandalf felt that Sauron would take advantage of Middle-earth's weakened state: Arnor was no more, leaving Rivendell and Lothl\u00f3rien open to an attack, and the Dwarves of the Iron Hills were the only obstacle in regaining Angmar. Above all else however, he feared that Sauron would eventually forge an alliance with the dragon Smaug, whom the Dark Lord could use to terrible effect.[21] In TA 2850, Gandalf entered Dol Guldur again and finally confirmed that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron himself. Eventually, the White Council put forth their strength and, with Saruman's approval, attacked Dol Guldur in TA 2941[22][23] in the hopes of ousting Sauron before he and Smaug could \"help one another\".[24] The Wise were able to oust the weakened Sauron from Dol Guldur with relative ease, but Sauron had had ample time to prepare for their assault, and only feigned retreat, abandoning Dol Guldur willingly. He returned secretly to Mordor, where he would openly declare himself in TA 2951, and began preparations for his final war to dominate Middle-earth.[23] However, shortly after Sauron's retreat from Dol Guldur, Smaug would be slain by Bard the First, eliminating the Dark Lord's most powerful potential ally.\nWar of the Ring\nSauron and his servants, as depicted in a wallpaper for The Lord of the Rings: Rise to War.\n\"Now of late we have learned that the Enemy has been among [the Southrons], and they are gone over to Him, or back to Him-they were ever ready to His will-as have so many also in the East. I doubt not that the days of Gondor are numbered, and the walls of Minas Tirith are doomed, so great is His strength and malice.\"\n\u2014The Two Towers, \"Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit\"\nSauron bred immense armies of Orcs and other evil creatures and rallied Men from the east and south - many of which had served him in the past - to his banner. He also gathered his most terrifying servants, the Nazg\u00fbl, or Ringwraiths, each wearing one of the nine rings conceived for mortal Men. From among the Nine, Sauron sent Kham\u00fbl, the Second Chief, to resettle Dol Guldur and prepare it for war against Thranduil's neighbouring realm. He once again adopted the symbol of a lidless eye, and as he exerted his will over Middle-earth, the Eye of Sauron was recognized by all as a symbol of power and fear.\nAs part of his strategy against the kingdoms of Men, Sauron began to weaken Gondor by influencing Denethor II. Using the Palant\u00edr of Minas Ithil, the Dark Lord convinced the Ruling Steward, current owner of the Anor-stone, of his imminent victory; Denethor gradually succumbed to despair.\n\"Saruman fell under the domination of Sauron and desired his victory, or no longer opposed it.\"\n\u2014Unfinished Tales of N\u00famenor and Middle-earth, \"The Palant\u00edri\"\nBy TA 3000, the \"shadow of Mordor reached out to Rohan\".  Through the Ithil-stone, Sauron communed with Saruman, who held the Orthanc-stone, and compelled him to betray the White Council and serve him with promises of power and \"rich reward\".[25] Having become the Wizard's \"dark master\",[26]  Sauron then commanded Saruman to subjugate Rohan and form in Isengard a second pincer to crush Gondor. For the time being, Sauron tolerated the fact that Saruman was actually a faithless servant that coveted the Ring, as he could \"read his thought even when he withheld information.\"[27]\nThe Ringwraiths in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring film\nAfter Gollum was captured, Sauron had him tortured and learned that he once had a magic ring, and, from him, he heard the words Shire and Baggins. He deduced that Gollum's ring was the One Ring and released the creature in TA 3017, hoping that Gollum would unwittingly lead him to Baggins. But Gollum's trail was lost in the Dead Marshes, \"where Sauron's emissaries. could not or would not follow him.\" The Dark Lord then learned that the creature had been captured by his enemies. Sauron decided to send the dreaded Nazg\u00fbl, to find the Shire and search for Baggins. To conceal the Nazg\u00fbl's mission and test Denethor's strength, Sauron launched an assault against Osgiliath in TA 3018. At the same time, his servants in Dol Guldur attacked Thranduil's realm, where Gollum was held, with orders to \"to capture or kill Gollum\". The creature, however, escaped both the Dark Lord and his enemies.[27]\nAlthough the Nazg\u00fbl found the Shire and came close to capturing Baggins at Weathertop, they ultimately failed to retrieve the Ring and thus returned to the Dark Lord empty-handed. Sauron then sent a Mordor-orc warband led by Grishn\u00e1kh to join a group of Isengarders that was tracking down the Fellowship of the Ring. The Orcs ambushed the company at Amon Hen and successfully captured two Hobbits, but were slowed down by internal strife - partially caused by Saruman's disloyalty - and later slain on the eaves of Fangorn Forest by the Rohirrim.\nHaving \"cheated [his] new master\" by trying to claim the Ring for himself,[26] Saruman made a final assault against Th\u00e9oden King at Helm's Deep in hopes of conquering Rohan for Sauron and regaining his favor. The Wizard was defeated by the Rohirrim and Ents however, costing the Dark Lord one of his most powerful vassals, as well the large army of Isengard.\nAragorn reveals himself to Sauron through the palant\u00edr\nShortly after Saruman's defeat, Peregrin Took looked into the Orthanc-stone and accidentally communicated with Sauron. At first, the Dark Lord believed he was talking to his servant and reprimanded him for neglecting to report. Realizing that the other surveyor was a Hobbit, Sauron then assumed that Pippin was Saruman's prisoner and tried to coerce information out of him. But shortly thereafter Aragorn took the palant\u00edr and revealed himself to Sauron, and seeing Aragorn, the Dark Lord concluded that his vassal had fallen and that Isildur's heir possessed the One Ring. Fearing that his enemies would use the Ring against him, Sauron sped up his plans and attacked the city of Minas Tirith in Gondor sooner than he had planned, seeking to raze the city and crush the last human resistance to his rule before his enemies could fortify it, and to prevent the Men of the West uniting under one king.\nDue to the combined efforts of Gondor, Rohan, and the D\u00fanedain of Arnor, Sauron's army was defeated. Despite still possessing more than enough military strength to destroy Minas Tirith and easily conquer Middle-earth once Gondor fell, doubt began to grow in Sauron. As such, he watched and waited, hoping for a period of strife between Aragorn and other potential Ringlords in which he could move out and take the Ring for himself.\nDownfall\n\"If it [the Ring] is destroyed, then he will fall, and his fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising ever again. For he will lose the best part of the strength that was native to him in his beginning, and all that was made or begun with that power will crumble, and he will be maimed for ever, becoming a mere spirit of malice that gnaws itself in the shadows, but cannot again grow or take shape. And so a great evil of this world will be removed.\"\n\u2014The Return of the King, \"The Last Debate\"\nDespite their successful repulse of Sauron's armies at Minas Tirith, Gandalf and Aragorn knew that the bulk of Sauron's forces remained in Mordor, readying themselves for another, deadlier strike against the city. Filled as Mordor was with Sauron's troops, Frodo Baggins stood almost no chance of reaching Mount Doom undetected. In light of the situation, Aragorn called for a council consisting of the major commanders of all the forces present in Minas Tirith, and appointed Gandalf to be their commander until the crisis had passed. Gandalf made it clear to all those present that, despite their great victory, they ultimately could not hope to defeat Sauron's armies by force. Therefore, they had two options available. They could station their remaining force, considerably greater than it had been before the battle due to the reinforcements from Rohan and southern Gondor, at Minas Tirith and hope to endure Sauron's next attack. Or, they could take a force to the Black Gate and attempt to challenge Sauron directly.\nThis force, as Gandalf suggested, would only need to be great enough to offer battle, and the rest of their forces could remain behind to garrison Minas Tirith. This option, though suicidal for those involved, would serve to distract Sauron from gazing into his own land, through which the Ring Bearer would be traveling. Furthermore, Gandalf theorised that, once Sauron learned that a force too small to pose any real threat to him was on its way to the Black Gate to directly assault Mordor, he would likely believe that the leader of the attacking force would have the One Ring in their possession. Sauron would assume that the Ring itself would influence its wielder, who, in his pride and overconfidence in his newfound power, might be foolish enough to challenge Sauron's might with a force too small to assault Mordor in earnest.[28]\nTheir plot worked, as Sauron marshaled most of his remaining forces and marched them towards Ud\u00fbn to crush the Men of the West and regain his prize. This action left the Plains of Gorgoroth largely unguarded, allowing Frodo and Sam to reach Mount Doom with far less difficulty than otherwise. However, once Frodo reached the Cracks of Doom, he finally succumbed to the power of the Ring, and put it on. Immediately, Sauron became aware of the halfling, and turned his gaze towards the mountain. He frantically sent the Ringwraiths to retrieve the Ring, but was too late, as Gollum, after taking the Ring from Frodo, slipped and fell to his death into the Cracks of Doom. The Ring was unmade. The earth shook as a great shock wave rippled across Mordor, and the foundations of Barad-d\u00fbr were finally destroyed, causing the great fortress to fall into ruin once and for all. The cone of Mount Doom burst apart in a cataclysmic eruption that consumed the eight remaining Nazg\u00fbl.[29]\nSauron's shadow looming over the Army of the West before being blown away\nWith his source of power gone, Sauron was utterly defeated and his armies bereft of the driving will behind their conquest were swollowed up by the earth and destroyed. With the One Ring destroyed, Sauron was permanently robbed of his physical form, reducing him to a malevolent spirit that hovered above Mordor as a \"huge shape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning-crowned, ...terrible but impotent,\" only to be blown away by a great wind;[30] he had ended on the same path as his old master, Morgoth, and was condemned to a sleepless impotent malice that feeds on itself.\nWith the destruction of the Ring, the vast majority of Sauron's being and his power was forever lost. With that, Sauron's spirit no longer had the power to create a new body and take shape again. Though his indestructible mind and being were bound forever to E\u00e4, Sauron had lost all power to effect his will upon the world and could never again grow in strength.",

It was eventually seduced and corrupted by Melkor, becoming one of the Valaraukar and joining with the other Balrogs in Morgoth's service. The Balrog likely fought in many battles of the War of the Great Jewels, up to and including\u00a0the War of Wrath. It somehow managed to survive Morgoth's defeat, fleeing east and taking refuge beneath the Misty Mountains.\nThe Dwarves' first contact with the Balrog as depicted by Robert Zigo\nThird Age[]\nFor more than five thousand years, the Balrog lay dormant at the roots of the Misty Mountains beneath the Dwarven kingdom of Khazad-d\u00fbm. It remained undisturbed throughout the Second Age and most of the Third Age, until the Dwarves awoke it in TA 1980 when they mined too deeply and too greedily in their search for mithril. It slew Durin VI that year, and his son N\u00e1in I attempted to destroy it a year later in TA 1981. He was also slain by the Balrog, after this the Dwarves of Durin's Folk abandoned their ancient home.\nIn TA 2799 after the Battle of Azanulbizar, Thr\u00e1in II wished to re-enter Moria, but was stopped by D\u00e1in Ironfoot, who alone had reached the threshold and saw the waiting Balrog.\nDurin's Bane before Gandalf on the Bridge, by Xavier Collette\nIn January of TA 3019, the Fellowship of the Ring traveled through Moria on their way to Mordor. There, they were attacked in the Chamber of Mazarbul by Orcs. The Fellowship fled through a side door, but when Gandalf, who was also a Maia, tried to place a \"shutting spell\" on the door to block the pursuit behind them, the Balrog entered the chamber on the other side and cast a counterspell. Gandalf spoke a word of command to stay the door, but the door shattered and the chamber collapsed.\nThe company fled with Gandalf, but the Orcs and the Balrog, taking a different route, caught up with them at the Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm. At the Bridge, Legolas instantly recognized it as a Balrog, and Gimli recognized it as Durin's Bane. Gandalf, the only one capable of battling it, then commanded the rest of the Fellowship to flee across the bridge, where he then stood, blocking the Balrog's way. The demon's flames then seemed to die, but its shadow increased before attacking with its flaming sword, which melted into red-hot liquid metal when it met Gandalf's own sword, Glamdring. The Balrog then leapt onto the bridge, brandishing its whip, and in response Gandalf smote the Bridge before him with his staff. The staff broke asunder, a blinding sheet of white flame springing up, and the bridge cracked at the feet of the Balrog, who fell forward into the abyss. But as the Balrog fell, it lashed out with its whip, catching Gandalf and dragging him over the edge and into the darkness below.[1]\nDurin's Bane and Gandalf in a swamp, at the utter bottom of Moria, by Eric Velhagen\nAfter a long fall, the two crashed into a great subterranean lake, which Gandalf later said was as cold as the tide of death and almost froze his heart. The water quenched the Balrog's fire, reducing it to \"a thing of slime, stronger than a strangling snake\". Despite this relatively weak state, Durin's Bane renewed its attack on the wizard, and the two fought in the water, with the Balrog clutching at Gandalf to strangle him, and Gandalf hewing the Balrog with his sword, until finally the Balrog fled into ancient tunnels delved by nameless things. There, Gandalf pursued the creature up the Endless Stair and onto Durin's Tower, where Gandalf finally prevailed in the Battle of the Peak and slew the Balrog, casting it down from the peak of Zirakzigil and sending it crashing onto the mountain side.\nThe fall of Durin's Bane atop Zirak-zigil, by Donato Giancola\nThe ultimate fate of Durin's Bane is not known, as only its physical form died, as with all Maiar when they were \"killed,\" but what happened to the spirit of the Balrog was not revealed. It is also unknown if it was the last of its kind, or if there were other Balrogs who managed to escape the War of Wrath and remained hidden in long forgotten places.[2]",

However, two more joined the original three, making them five. Aiwendil (Radagast) was chosen by Yavanna to travel with Curumo, and Alatar took Pallando as a companion. Upon arrival in Middle-earth, Alatar and Pallando were dressed in robes of sea-blue. Due to this, they were called the Blue Wizards (or Ithryn Luin in Sindarin). Along with Saruman, they traveled east in an attempt to help free the Haradrim and Easterlings from Sauron's service. Later, Saruman returned to the west alone.

In the Years\u00a0of the Trees,\u00a0Arien tended to the golden flower gardens of V\u00e1na, watering the flowers with bright dews collected from the great, golden tree Laurelin. Later, the Valar chose Arien to carry the new vessel of the Sun\u00a0because she was the only one who could courageously bear the heats of Laurelin, and was unhurt by it.[1] While in Valinor, Arien took a physical form similar to that of the Valar; but when she left Valinor, she forsook her raiment and became a \"naked flame of fire, terrible in the fullness of her splendour\".[2]\nArien holding the sun.\nLater on, when the great Two Trees of Valinor were destroyed by Morgoth \u00a0and Ungoliant,\u00a0the golden tree Laurelin managed to produce one last golden fruit before it died away. Subsequently\u00a0Aul\u00eb,\u00a0the \"Greatest Craftsman of Arda\", then created a vessel to hold the last golden fruit of Laurelin. However, the Maia Tilion, chosen to steer the vessel of the Moon, had traversed seven times before the vessel of the Sun was ready. So after the vessel for the Sun, named Anar the Fire-golden was ready at last, Arien carried it up into the Heavens, giving light to the World. Hence, Anar rose in glory and the first dawn of the Sun was like a great fire glowing upon the towers of the Pel\u00f3ri mountains in Aman. And the clouds of Middle-earth were kindled, and many waterfalls were heard. At this, Morgoth\u00a0was dismayed, and he descended to the lowest pits of Angband, withdrawing his servants as well. Thence, Morgoth sent forth great reeks and darkness of clouds to hide his own land from the new light of the Sun. Morgoth feared Arien greatly, and dared not come close to her.[2] It was said that Arien easily burned away the dark powers, but Tilion was waylaid and hard-pressed to hold his own, but still managed to pull through.[2]\nIt has been told that Arien was more powerful than Tilion, who was drawn to Arien and occasionally followed her\u00a0through the night sky but when catching up to her, the Island of the Moon became burned and blackened by Arien's heat when in close proximity to her. Moreover, the Valar stored the great radiance of the Sun in many vessels, vats, and pools to use for their comfort in times of darkness.[1] As Arien was the \"Guardian of the Sun\", she was one of the most loved of the\u00a0Maiar by mortal Men, as her first journey across the sky was the signal of the Awakening of Men.[2]",

Her love calmed the violent tidal waves and storms created by Oss\u00eb her husband by keeping him in line and not going too far. Her hair spread throughout waters and lies on their surfaces. During the early days Arda, Oss\u00eb rebelled against his Lord Ulmo\u00a0(Lord of All Waters)\u00a0and served Melkor instead, being carried away by the false promises that Melkor gave to him. For a while, there rose great tumults in the sea that wrought great ruins to the lands. Because of this, and because of the prayers of Aul\u00eb\u00a0who created those lands, Uinen helped bring Oss\u00eb back to the allegiance of their lord Ulmo by restraining her husband and bringing him before Ulmo. Following that, Oss\u00eb was pardoned and gave his allegiance back to the Valar.[1] To the Maiar Uinen and Oss\u00eb, Ulmo gave them the task of the governing of the waves and the movements of the Inner Seas. Ever afterwards, Uinen was the one who restrained Oss\u00eb's bouts of violence in the seas and on the coasts.[2]\nEventually, when the Teleri remained on the coast of the western seas, awaiting Ulmo to take them to Aman, Uinen and Oss\u00eb came among the Teleri and befriended them.[3] After the Kinslaying at Alqualond\u00eb, where\u00a0F\u00ebanor and his host of exiled \u00d1oldor attacked the Teleri and stole their ships, Uinen wept for the Telerin mariners who had been wickedly slain and tossed into the sea.\u00a0The sea also rose in great wrath against the \u00d1oldorin slayers, so that many of the stolen Telerin ships were wrecked and the \u00d1oldor in them were drowned.[4]\nWhen the Hiding of Valinor took place, Oss\u00eb raised the enchanted Isles. Then next, Uinen enchanted those who ever managed to reach the Isles by weaving them in her hair before Irmo\u00a0(Master of Dreams & Desires)\u00a0put them to age-long sleep.[5]\nSecond Age[]\nIn the Second Age, the mariners of N\u00famen\u00f3r would cry to Uinen for help, because she was the only one capable of calming Oss\u00eb who loved to create tumults in the seas. And the N\u00famen\u00f3reans lived under her protection while their respect for the Valar endured. Therefore, the N\u00famen\u00f3reans held the Maia Uinen in reverence as equal to the Valar.[1]",

        "biography": "Sundering of the Elves[]\nElw\u00eb was born in Cuivi\u00e9nen during the Years of the Trees to unnamed parents, and his father was the direct descendant of Enel and Enely\u00eb.[3] He first appears in the history of the Eldar when he travelled from Cuivi\u00e9nen with Orom\u00eb as ambassador of the Teleri to see the land of Valinor. Upon his return, he convinced many of his people to follow him back to that country. On the Elves' Great Journey to the West, the Teleri lingered behind and did not arrive at the coast until later, after the departure of the moving island of Tol Eress\u00eba. Thus, they stayed in Beleriand for many years until Tol Eress\u00eba was brought back to ferry them, by which time many of the Teleri had grown to love Beleriand and decided to stay there. Elw\u00eb was among them, having encountered Melian the Maia in the woods of Nan Elmoth and fallen deeply in love with her. Afterwards, he disappeared for many years causing many of his people to linger in Middle-earth to search for him.[4]\nRule of Doriath[]\nFor centuries, Elw\u00eb remained lost until he reemerged as a respected lord and many of his people joined him in the forest of Doriath, in Beleriand. Now known as Elu Thingol, he and Melian became king and queen of the Teleri that remained in Beleriand. This people became known as the Sindar. He founded a realm in a large forested area in Beleriand first known as Eglador (Land of the Forsaken). During these early days under the stars, Thingol and Melian had a daughter, L\u00fathien, who was said to be the fairest woman ever to have lived.\nAs Lord of Beleriand, Thingol welcomed his long lost kin, now known as the Laiquendi or Green-elves, into vast lands in Ossiriand. He was also the first Elf to make contact and alliances with the Dwarves of Belegost, who helped delve the caves of Menegroth, which became the capital of Thingol's kingdom. When the Dwarves first became aware of unfamiliar savage creatures coming out of the North, Thingol was the first to learn, and, possessing no heavy weapons of war, he once again asked the Dwarves for their aid. They forged for him necessary weapons and armour, for what would be the onset of war against Melkor.[5]\nThingol, by Maureval\nQuest for the Silmaril[]\nElw\u00eb is enchanted by Melian in the woods of Nan Elmoth, by IreneLangholm\nWhen Melkor returned to Middle-earth, he sought once again to master it and its peoples, and declared war on them. He sent great hosts of Orcs into Beleriand, starting what became known as the First Battle of Beleriand. In this battle, Thingol led his people to victory against the Orcs, driving them out of his kingdom and most of Beleriand. Afterwards, Melian set the Girdle around his kingdom, which was thence named Doriath; no one could now enter the realm without Thingol's permission. When the \u00d1oldor returned to Middle-earth, he gave them leave to dwell in the north part and dealt only with the House of Finarfin as they were kin through his brother Olw\u00eb. When he learned of the Kinslaying at Alqualond\u00eb, he was outraged and wanted nothing to do with most of the \u00d1oldor and their war and even outlawed the use of Quenya in his kingdom.[6]\nThingol was drawn into the war with Morgoth and the deadly Oath of F\u00ebanor when after the Dagor Bragollach, L\u00fathien fell in love with a man named Beren. Thingol did not wish for the two to be wedded to each other, as he valued his daughter very highly and disliked the race of Men. As a bride-price he asked for a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth, thinking there was no way that Beren could fulfil this demand. Thus, Thingol was drawn into the quarrels over the great jewels and ultimately the doom of F\u00ebanor.[7]\nDeath[]\nIt was this bride-price that doomed Thingol. After H\u00farin brought the treasures of Nargothrond to Doriath, Thingol summoned Dwarves of Belegost to Menegroth and invited them to work the treasure into jewelry. The finest of these pieces was the Nauglam\u00edr.\nThe Nauglam\u00edr was the second-greatest treasure of Doriath, prized above all but Beren and L\u00fathien's Silmaril. After the smiths of Belegost finished their work on the Nauglam\u00edr, Thingol requested that the Dwarves of Nogrod set the Silmaril in it. The Nauglam\u00edr, now bearing the Silmaril was held to be the fairest object in Arda.\nEnthralled by and covetous of the Silmaril, the Dwarves demanded the necklace, insisting that as a dwarven work it belonged to them. Thingol was unwilling to surrender the treasure and replied with an impertinent answer. In their anger, the Dwarves attempted to slay him. After a long battle between Dwarves and Elves inside the city, the Dwarves were expelled. Two escaped to Nogrod and there told a false story of the conflict to their people, convincing them to march westward and do battle in the Thousand Caves. Later, with the help of certain treacherous Elves also possessed of the cursed treasure, Dwarves regained entrance past the Girdle. Thingol was lured out on a hunt with a small company of arms; he was ambushed by Dwarves in the woods, and was slain, allowing Menegroth to be taken and plundered. The Dwarves could not seize nor harm Melian, and she departed to seek Beren and L\u00fathien.[8]\nThingol's heir was Dior Eluchil, the son of Beren and L\u00fathien.[9]\nThingol as king, by Antonio Vinci",

At the age of seven, he and his parents escaped the Sack of Gondolin, living afterwards in Arvernien by the mouth of Sirion.[3][5] The survivors of Gondolin and Doriath mingled at the Havens of Sirion. In FA 525,[2] E\u00e4rendil wedded Elwing, daughter of King Dior. Two years later, Elros and Elrond were born to them, and E\u00e4rendil began his voyage in search of Tuor and Idril, who had earlier departed over the Sea. With the aid of C\u00edrdan the Shipwright, E\u00e4rendil built a ship for this purpose, Vingil\u00f3t\u00eb.[6]\nE\u00e4rendil searches Tirion, by Ted Nasmith\nAt this time, Elwing had in her possession the Silmaril that Beren had once wrested from Morgoth. News of this came to the remaining Sons of F\u00ebanor, and they attacked the people living in Arvernien, slaying most of them.\u00a0C\u00edrdan\u00a0and Gil-galad sent ships to their aid, but were too late.\u00a0But Elwing, to avoid capture, threw herself with the Silmaril into the Sea, leaving her young sons behind.[6]\nHearing of the tragedy of Arvernien, E\u00e4rendil then sought after Valinor, and he and Elwing found their way there at last. E\u00e4rendil thus became the first of all mortals to set foot in Valinor. E\u00e4rendil then went before the Valar, and asked them for aid that would help the Men and Elves in Middle-earth fight against Morgoth; and the Valar accepted his plea.[6]\nE\u00e4rendil slays Ancalagon, by Ted Nasmith\nBecause E\u00e4rendil had undertaken this errand on behalf of Men and Elves, and not for his own sake, Manw\u00eb forbore to deal out the punishment of death that was due; and because both E\u00e4rendil and Elwing were descended from a union of Elves and Men, Manw\u00eb granted to them and their sons the gift to choose to which race they would be joined (a gift that was further passed to the children of Elrond, who became known as the Half-elves). Elwing chose to be one of the Elves. E\u00e4rendil would have rather been one of the Men; however, for the sake of his wife, he chose to be one of the Elves.[6]\nThe Valar, having listened to E\u00e4rendil's plea, went with a mighty host to Middle-earth during the War of Wrath, overthrew Morgoth, and bound him. E\u00e4rendil took part in the battle, riding on Vingilot beside Thorondor and the Eagles. It was his blow that slew Ancalagon the Black, the greatest of Morgoth's winged dragons; and his dead body fell on Thangorodrim, the event which, along with the sheer devastation caused by the War of Wrath, led to the ruin of Beleriand.[6] E\u00e4rendil's fate was to eternally traverse the Great Ocean with the Silmaril that Beren and L\u00fathien had wrested from Morgoth and guard the Sun and Moon.\nIn the Second Prophecy of Mandos, it is told that E\u00e4rendil will return from the sky for the love of the Sun and Moon that Melkor would blot out, and fight in the Dagor Dagorath.",

Goatleaf got a lantern and questioned them gruffly about their intentions, silently observing that they came from the Shire before letting them in. Before wishing them good night, he warned them that there would be more folk besides him at The Prancing Pony who would ask them questions.[1]\nWhen Strider advised the four Hobbits to be more careful as the Nazg\u00fbl were seen passing the Greenway the previous Monday, Frodo realized that he should have known this from the way Goatleaf spoke to them. Later, when Strider predicted that something may happen that night before they leave Bree, he mentioned that Goatleaf may be a spy for the Nazg\u00fbl, noting the conversation he had overheard the previous Monday.[4]\nBefore the end of 3018, the Bree-men kicked the Ruffians among the Southerners out of Bree. Early in the New Year of 3019 however, the town was attacked in the night by the very same Ruffians. During the battle, Goatleaf fought on the side of the Ruffians along with Bill Ferny. After the battle, Goatleaf left Bree alongside the other Ruffians, hiding out in either the Chetwood beyond Archet, or in the wilds north of Bree. Later, it was believed by Barliman Butterbur that Goatleaf and Ferny were the ones who let the Ruffians in on the night of the battle.[5] It is likely that Goatleaf's position as a Gate-keeper was presumably later taken by another Gate-keeper."
