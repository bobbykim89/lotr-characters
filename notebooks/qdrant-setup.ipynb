He was born in the refuge of the Havens of Sirion in Beleriand late in the First Age, soon before its sack by the Sons of FÃ«anor. Elrond and his twin brother Elros were captured and raised by Maglor, a son of FÃ«anor. Though at first there was no great love between them, eventually Maglor took pity on them and cherished them, and eventually grew to love them.[3] By the end of the First Age and the War of Wrath, the Sons of FÃ«anor were again working alone, suggesting that by this time, Elrond and Elros had left their nominal captivity and traveled to Lindon.\\nSecond Age\\nElrond and Elros were given the choice at the end of the First Age to be counted among Men or Elves. Elros chose the Fate of Men and became Elros Tar-Minyatur, the first King of NÃºmenor. Elrond Half-elven chose to be counted among the Elves,[4] and remained in Lindon as captain and herald of Gil-galad, the High King of the Ã‘oldor.[5]\\nWith the start of the War of the Elves and Sauron in SA 1695, Elrond was sent to Eregion by Gil-galad in an attempt to protect it from the invading forces of Sauron. Unfortunately, Elrond's host arrived too late and was not large enough on its own to defeat Sauron's army. He retreated north with the refugees of Eregion, including Celeborn, only escaping because the forces of Durin III assailed Sauron's army in the rear. It was during the following two years (SA 1697) that Elrond founded Rivendell at the feet of the Misty Mountains, as a sanctuary and stronghold. For the next four years, Rivendell was besieged by Sauron's forces.\\nWith the arrival of the NÃºmenÃ³reans, the army besieging Rivendell was caught between the forces of Gil-galad and Elrond and destroyed. Elrond remained in Rivendell and hosted the first White Council, attended by Galadriel, at which it was decided that Elrond's home, the Last Homely House, would remain the last stronghold west of the Misty Mountains, and that the Three Rings then held by Gil-galad and Galadriel would remain hidden. According to one account Gil-galad at this time gave Elrond Vilya the Blue Ring, though in other accounts Gil-galad kept both Narya and Vilya until the end of the Second Age. It was also here that Elrond first met CelebrÃ­an, the daughter of Celeborn and Galadriel.\\nElrond in battle during the War of the Last Alliance, as portrayed in the films\\nNear the end of the Second Age, Elrond rode beside Gil-galad in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, which set out from Rivendell to Mordor in SA 3431. Elrond was Gil-galad's herald during the war against Sauron. The Alliance, which also included Elves from LothlÃ³rien, Men from Arnor and Gondor, and Dwarves likely led by Durin IV, defeated Sauron's army at the Battle of Dagorlad and laid siege to Barad-dÃ»r for seven years. Eventually, Sauron himself was defeated by Elendil and Gil-galad, allowing Isildur to cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger and claim it for himself.\\nThe war took a toll on the forces of both Elves and Men. Gil-galad, Elendil, and his younger son AnÃ¡rion were killed in the siege. Elrond and CÃ­rdan only remained as the commanders of the Elves, and Isildur as High King of the Realms in Exile. Upon discovering that Isildur had claimed the One Ring for himself, Elrond urged Isildur to throw the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, but the seduction of the Ring made Isildur refuse. Isildur claimed the Ring as a weregild for his father and brother, and Elrond (perhaps not fully understanding the nature of the One Ring) acknowledged his claim. Elrond then returned to Rivendell at the end of the war.[6]\\nThird Age\\nElrond riding out of Rivendell, by Robert Zigo\\nIn the year TA 109, Elrond wedded CelebrÃ­an. In the year TA 130, the twins Elladan and Elrohir were born, and in TA 241 a daughter, Arwen UndÃ³miel.

Elrond, foreseeing the boy's difficult future gave him the name Estel, Sindarin for hope.

       "'Name: Aragorn II Elessar | Race: Men | Gender: Male | Realm: Reunited Kingdom,Arnor,Gondor | Birth: March 1 ,2931 | Death: FO 120 | Spouse: Arwen | Hair: Dark | Height: 198cm (6\\'6\") | Biography: Early years\\nAragorn as a toddler, portrayed by Luke Johnston in the fan film Born of Hope\\nHe was Aragorn son of Arathorn, the nine and thirtieth heir in the right line from Isildur, and yet more like Elendil than any before him.â€”The Silmarillion, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\\nAragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur through the line of the Lords of AndÃºniÃ« to Elendil, High King of Arnor and Gondor. Like all of the kings before him, he was Elrond\\'s kin through the House of Elros.  His ancestor Arvedui was wedded to FÃ­riel, descended from AnÃ¡rion, who bore their son Aranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant of both Isildur and AnÃ¡rion.\\nWhen he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while pursuing Orcs. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond. At the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn was renamed \"Estel\" and was not told about his heritage until 2951.[1]\\nYoung Aragorn with the shards of Narsil, by Anna Lee\\nElrond revealed to \"Estel\" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, giving him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil, but withholding the Sceptre of AnnÃºminas from Aragorn until he \"came of the right\" to possess the item. It was also around this time that Aragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond\\'s daughter, newly returned from her mother\\'s homeland of LothlÃ³rien where she had been visiting her grandmother Galadriel.[1]\\nAragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of the DÃºnedain and left the comforts of Rivendell for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his people, the Rangers of the North, whose kingdom had been destroyed through division and the Angmar Wars centuries before.[1]\\nAragorn met Gandalf the Grey in 2956 and they became close friends. Heeding Gandalf\\'s advice, Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small land known as the Shire inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian Hobbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the Shire\\'s borders as Strider.\\nFrom TA 2957 to TA 2980, Aragorn undertook great journeys, serving in the armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor. Many of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the growing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he earned priceless experience which he would later put to use in the War of the Ring. Aragorn served these lords in disguise and his name in Gondor and Rohan during that time was Thorongil (\"Eagle of the Star\"). With a small squadron of ships from Gondor, he led an assault on the long-standing City of the Corsairs in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs\\' ships and personally overthrowing the Captain of the Haven during a battle upon the quays. After the victory at Umbar, \"Thorongil\" left Gondor and, to the dismay of his men, went east.[2]\\nLater in 2980, he visited LothlÃ³rien, and there once again met Arwen. He gave her the heirloom of his House, the Ring of Barahir, and, on the hill of Cerin Amroth, Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage, renouncing her Elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of IlÃºvatar: Death.[1]\\nElrond withheld from Aragorn permission to marry his daughter until such a time as his foster son should be king of \"both\" Gondor and Arnor. As both Elrond and Aragorn knew, to marry a mortal, Arwen would be required to choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless Elrond of his daughter while the world lasted. Elrond was also concerned for Arwen\\'s own happiness'"
