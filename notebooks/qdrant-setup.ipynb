After fighting in the Siege of Angband, Dagor Bragollach, Battle of the Pass of Aglond and Fall of Tol Sirion, he lived with his father and uncle in Nargothrond, staying even after Curufin\\'s exile. After fighting in Nirnaeth Arnoediad, he fought in Sack of Nargothrond, and then escaped and traveled to Gondolin. He fought and survived the Fall of Gondolin and Third Kinslaying. Celebrimbor finally fought in the War of Wrath.  Unlike some of his kin, he remained in Middle-earth afterwards.\\nSecond Age\\nCelebrimbor settled in Eregion in the Second Age and started dealing with the Dwarves of the realm of Khazad-dÃ»m. In SA 1500, Sauron, calling himself Annatar  (\"Lord of Gifts\"), befriended the Ã‘oldor of Eregion. He claimed to be an emissary of the Valar, especially AulÃ«, and instructed them in the art of ring-making.[4] Celebrimbor distrusted him, but the smiths of Eregion were deceived. Under the guidance and instruction of Sauron, the smiths openly made rings to learn the craft and Celebrimbor himself forged the three Elven rings without assistance from Sauron. But unbeknownst to him, the craft taught by Sauron incorporated a binding magic into the rings.\\nCelebrimbor and Annatar forging the Rings\\nIn secret, Sauron forged the One Ring, a master ring that would rule all the lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth via its influence over those who used the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on his finger, claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their bearers, the Elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor and the Elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings from him. The greatest of the rings (aside from the One Ring) were created by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron and thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to the One Ring. These were the three Rings of the Elves, the fairest of the Rings of Power. Celebrimbor named them Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after the principal Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water, respectively. He sent the three rings away for safekeeping: Vilya and Narya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel in LÃ³rien. Celebrimbor also sent the mightiest of the seven to Durin III of Khazad-dÃ»m.\\nSauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, laying waste to the realm. Celebrimbor was captured in the chaos and was forced, under torture, to disclose the locations of the lesser rings, but he would not reveal the whereabouts of the three greatest of them that he had sent away for safekeeping. Celebrimbor died from his torment; his body was shot with arrows and hung upon a pole, and was later paraded as a banner when Sauron attacked the Grey Havens.[5] Celebrimbor was the last direct descendant of the line of FÃ«anor, save perhaps for his father\\'s brother Maglor, whose fate was unknown and was said by some legends to still wander the shores of the Sea. It was unknown whether he married, no children were recorded.\\nCelebrimbor, by David Greset\\nHowever, related to the House of FÃ«anor were the Kings of Arnor and the Kings of Gondor, descendants of Celebrimbor\\'s great-grandfather FinwÃ«\\'s union with his second wife Indis. Among them were not just EÃ¤rendil, but also Arwen and her husband Aragorn II, who helped bring about Sauron\\'s final defeat in the War of the Ring.',\n",

The Lords of AndÃºniÃ« were descended from the Kings of NÃºmenor through SilmariÃ«n, the daughter and eldest child of the fourth King of NÃºmenor, Tar-Elendil.[2]\\nAnÃ¡rion and Isildur (right) in their youth, by Billy Mosig\\nElros, the Half-elven and the first King of NÃºmenor, had chosen the life of Men, while his brother Elrond chose the life of Elves. Over time, the Kings of NÃºmenor grew to resent their ancestor's choice, and desired eternal life for themselves. They became estranged from the Elves and the Valar, and neglected the worship of Eru, who had created them. A small group of NÃºmenÃ³reans remained friendly with the Elves and faithful to Eru and the Valar. They were called the Faithful. Among these men were the Lords of AndÃºniÃ«.\\nIn SA 3262, Ar-PharazÃ´n, King of NÃºmenor, took Sauron captive and brought him to NÃºmenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken in order to corrupt the NÃºmenÃ³reans, to orchestrate their downfall. Over time, he succeeded in gaining influence over the NÃºmenÃ³rean authorities.\\nIsildur learned that Sauron wanted King Ar-PharazÃ´n to cut down Nimloth, the White Tree that had come from the Undying Lands. Isildur disguised himself and went secretly to the King's Court and took a fruit from Nimloth. The guards discovered and attacked him and, although receiving grave injuries, he managed to escape with the fruit. For this deed, Isildur received much praise. He stood near death for many months, but when the fruit of the White Tree began to sprout, he awoke and was recovered from his injuries.[2]\\nAs Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave NÃºmenor. They filled nine ships with their families and many of their prized possessions, including the palantÃ­ri. Isildur had three ships of his own, and he brought aboard the seedling of the White Tree, the Stone of Erech, as well as his wife and his son Elendur, who had been born in SA 3299.[1]\\nIsildur's grandfather Amandil hoped to plead with the Valar to spare the Faithful. He sailed westward toward the Undying Lands, but what became of him is not known and he was never seen again.\\nLife in Middle-earth[]\\nThe nine ships of the Faithful were spared from the tumult of NÃºmenor's downfall, and a great wind from the west sent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north with four ships, while Isildur and AnÃ¡rion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the south with three and two ships respectively. Elendil and his sons established the North-kingdom of Arnor and the South-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the High King of both realms, but he ruled from Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor to his sons.[3]\\nIsildur lived in Minas Ithil to the east of the Anduin, while AnÃ¡rion made his home in Minas Anor to the west of the Anduin. They ruled from their joint capital of Osgiliath, built on both banks of the river. Isildur built Minas Ithil in a valley of the Mountains of Shadow on the border of Mordor, planting the White Tree of Gondor before his house there. Minas Ithil was a beautiful city, but it was also a stronghold to defend against the evil that might still dwell in Mordor. It was not known at first that Sauron had survived the Downfall and had begun to rebuild his strength.\\nIsildur had one of the palantÃ­r called the Ithil-stone, which he used to communicate with his brother and father. Isildur and his wife had two more sons while living in Gondor - Aratan born in SA 3339 and Ciryon born in SA 3379.\\nIn the early days of Gondor, Isildur went to the Hill of Erech at the entrance to Imlad Morthond in the White Mountains. On the hilltop he placed the Stone of Erech, a great black sphere that he had brought from NÃºmenor. Isildur met with the King of the Mountain Men, who swore allegiance to Isildur upon the Stone, but later when Isildur called upon the Men of the Mountains to join the fight against Sauron, they refused. Isildur cursed them and said that they would never rest until they fulfilled their oath, and they haunted the Paths of the Dead.[4]\\nSauron attacked and captured Minas Ithil in SA 3429. Isildur escaped with his wife and sons and a seedling of the White Tree. Isildur and his family boarded a ship at the Mouths of the Anduin and sailed around the coast of Middle-earth, seeking Elendil in Arnor. Elendil consulted with Gil-galad, the last High King of the Ã‘oldor in Middle-earth who lived in Lindon west of Arnor. Gil-galad and Elendil formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men to oppose Sauron in SA 3430. That same year, Isildur's youngest son Valandil was born at the home of Elrond in Rivendell.\\nThe Last Alliance[]\\nThe army of the Last Alliance gathered at Rivendell in SA 3431[5] and then marched to war. Isildur and his three oldest sons Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon went with the army, while Isildur's wife and their young son Valandil remained in Rivendell.\\nThe War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434. Sauron's forces were defeated in the Battle of Dagorlad on the plain outside Mordor, and the army of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and laid siege to Barad-dÃ»r. The siege lasted seven years and many Men and Elves were killed, including Isildur's brother AnÃ¡rion, who died in SA 3440.[6]\\nIsildur taking the One Ring, after his father and Gil-galad are slain - by Ralph Damiani\\nAt last, in SA 3441, Sauron himself came down from his tower. He fought with Gil-galad and Elendil on the slopes of Mount Doom. Sauron's body was cast down, but Gil-galad and Elendil died in the struggle. Elendil's sword Narsil broke beneath him.\\nIsildur took up the hilt of the sword and used the broken blade to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Sauron's spirit fled from his body, but as long as the Ring that held much of his power survived so would his spirit. Enamored by the Ring's apparent beauty, Isildur took it for himself. Elrond and CÃ­rdan were the only two individuals who marked Isildur's actions, as they alone had been with Gil-galad during the contest with Sauron, and Isildur alone had stood by Elendil.[6] Not long after, with the heat-induced markings on the Ring still visible, Isildur wrote a short account of the Ring and its apparent properties, noting that it had burned his hand so badly that he believed he would be in permanent pain. He noted that the Ring, as it cooled, seemed to shrink, and that the writing upon its outer band seemed to be fading. He theorized that the heat from Sauron's hand might have caused the writing to remain visible, and that heating it again might produce the same effect. However, he was already so enthralled by the Ring that he refused, even in writing, to take any action which might cause harm to it.\\n\\nRule and death[]\\nIsildur assumed kingship of both Gondor and Arnor, but intended to return to the North and leave AnÃ¡rion's son Meneldil to rule in the south, after mentoring him in the duties of a King. On the summit of Amon Anwar in the Firien wood, Isildur entombed the body of his father Elendil. Before leaving Minas Anor, Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree recovered from Minas Ithil in memory of his brother and established the Tradition of Isildur.\\nDuring the few years in which Isildur had possession of the One Ring, he indicated that he had attempted to bend its tremendous power to his own will. However, he had failed in this endeavor, and the Ring's effects on his psyche had continued to grow until he could hardly bear it any longer. His eldest son and confidante, Elendur, suggested to his father that he should give the Ring into Elrond's keeping, and Isildur agreed.[7] On September 5, TA 2 of the Third Age, Isildur set out from Minas Anor with his three elder sons and a company of knights. They marched up the Vales of Anduin on the eastern side of the river, heading for the High Pass over the Misty Mountains.\\nThirty days later, on October 4, Isildur's company was attacked by Orcs near the Gladden Fields. The Orcs were unaware that Isildur had the One Ring, but instead were unwittingly drawn by its power. Isildur's men were outnumbered ten to one, and though they initially managed to repel the attack by forming a shield-wall, the Orcs renewed their assault after nightfall and the men were overwhelmed.[8]\\nIsildur putting on the Ring to escape\\nBefore the battle had begun, Isildur had sent away his esquire Ohtar, bearing the shards of his father's sword Narsil. Isildur kept the One Ring, but it was useless in defending his men against the Orcs.\\nIsildur's son Aratan was mortally wounded, and his son Ciryon was killed. His eldest son Elendur begged him to flee to in order to prevent the Orcs from capturing the Ring. Isildur agreed and parted with great sorrow from Elendur, who was slain leading the remaining DÃºnedain.\\nIsildur put on the Ring despite its pain and made for the River Anduin. He removed his armor and waded into the river intending to try to cross it. The current was strong and despite his great strength, it pulled him toward the marshes of the Gladden Fields. Then the Ring betrayed Isildur by slipping off his finger, and it then became lost in the waters. He rose out of the water but was spotted by Orcs who killed him with arrows.[7]\\nLegacy[]\\nThe One Ring remained at the bottom of the Anduin river in the Gladden Fields until DÃ©agol found it in TA 2463.[5] Isildur's body also lay in the waters, undiscovered by his kin, but his weapons and armour were later recovered near the place of battle.[7] As he had been wearing the Elendilmir, this was lost with him. Since the One Ring indirectly caused Isildur's death by slipping from his finger and revealing him to the Orcs, it became known in Gondor's lore as Isildur's Bane.\\nIsildur's youngest son Valandil became the High King of Arnor when he came of age in the year TA 10,[5] but he did not claim the Kingship of Gondor, and the two Kingdoms became separated. Gondor continued to be ruled by the heirs of AnÃ¡rion, while Arnor was ruled by the heirs of Isildur. It was not until the end of the Third Age that the Kingdoms were reunited by Aragorn II, Isildur's heir. During his reign, evidence for the full story of his death was finally uncovered, as the Elendilmir and the necklace holding the One Ring were found in a secret chamber in Orthanc.[7] Saruman had likely found Isildur's remains and had them burnt.\",\n",

That night, errand riders from Gondor arrived and presented him with the Red Arrow, a symbol of dire need and summons to fulfill the Oath of Eorl.\\nThÃ©oden then led six thousand Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, bravely charging the legions of Sauron, where he won great glory by defeating a chieftain of the Southrons along with the bearer of a banner depicting a black serpent.[5]\\n\\n\"Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a king of old\"\\nâ€”Tolkien\\'s description of ThÃ©oden charging the Orcs\\nKing ThÃ©oden dies\\nThÃ©oden slaying the Harad leader, by Kip Rasmussen\\nHe challenged the Witch-king of the nine Ringwraiths, and was mortally wounded when his horse Snowmane fell upon him after being spooked by the Witch-king\\'s winged steed. He was quickly protected by Ã‰owyn and Merry, both of whom had ridden to war in secret.[5]\\nThÃ©oden\\'s wounds were mortal and he perished on the Pelennor Fields. His body was preserved in the Hallows of Minas Tirith until Ã‰omer returned with a cortege. ThÃ©oden was then buried in the Barrowfield outside Edoras, the last king of the second line.[6]\\nAfter his death, the Rohirrim minstrel GlÃ©owine composed a song for him and the other Kings of Rohan.[6]\\nOut of doubt, out of dark, to the day\\'s rising\\nhe rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.\\nHope he rekindled, and in hope he ended;\\nover death, over dread, over doom lifted\\nout of loss, out of life, unto long glory.\\nThÃ©oden (right) on Snowmane leading his Rohirrim host in battle before Minas Tirith, by [https://naitsirk117.artstation.com Cristian Otazu',\n",
