       "  'biography': \"Life in NÃºmenor[]\\nIsildur was born in NÃºmenor in the year SA 3209 of the Second Age.[1] His younger brother AnÃ¡rion was born in SA 3219. They lived at the haven of RÃ³menna on the east coast of the island of NÃºmenor. Their father was Elendil and their grandfather was Amandil, the Lord of AndÃºniÃ«. The Lords of AndÃºniÃ« were descended from the Kings of NÃºmenor through SilmariÃ«n, the daughter and eldest child of the fourth King of NÃºmenor, Tar-Elendil.[2]\\nAnÃ¡rion and Isildur (right) in their youth, by Billy Mosig\\nElros, the Half-elven and the first King of NÃºmenor, had chosen the life of Men, while his brother Elrond chose the life of Elves. Over time, the Kings of NÃºmenor grew to resent their ancestor's choice, and desired eternal life for themselves. They became estranged from the Elves and the Valar, and neglected the worship of Eru, who had created them. A small group of NÃºmenÃ³reans remained friendly with the Elves and faithful to Eru and the Valar. They were called the Faithful. Among these men were the Lords of AndÃºniÃ«.\\nIn SA 3262, Ar-PharazÃ´n, King of NÃºmenor, took Sauron captive and brought him to NÃºmenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken in order to corrupt the NÃºmenÃ³reans, to orchestrate their downfall. Over time, he succeeded in gaining influence over the NÃºmenÃ³rean authorities.\\nIsildur learned that Sauron wanted King Ar-PharazÃ´n to cut down Nimloth, the White Tree that had come from the Undying Lands. Isildur disguised himself and went secretly to the King's Court and took a fruit from Nimloth. The guards discovered and attacked him and, although receiving grave injuries, he managed to escape with the fruit. For this deed, Isildur received much praise. He stood near death for many months, but when the fruit of the White Tree began to sprout, he awoke and was recovered from his injuries.[2]\\nAs Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave NÃºmenor. They filled nine ships with their families and many of their prized possessions, including the palantÃ­ri. Isildur had three ships of his own, and he brought aboard the seedling of the White Tree, the Stone of Erech, as well as his wife and his son Elendur, who had been born in SA 3299.[1]\\nIsildur's grandfather Amandil hoped to plead with the Valar to spare the Faithful. He sailed westward toward the Undying Lands, but what became of him is not known and he was never seen again.\\nLife in Middle-earth[]\\nThe nine ships of the Faithful were spared from the tumult of NÃºmenor's downfall, and a great wind from the west sent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north with four ships, while Isildur and AnÃ¡rion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the south with three and two ships respectively. Elendil and his sons established the North-kingdom of Arnor and the South-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the High King of both realms, but he ruled from Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor to his sons.[3]\\nIsildur lived in Minas Ithil to the east of the Anduin, while AnÃ¡rion made his home in Minas Anor to the west of the Anduin. They ruled from their joint capital of Osgiliath, built on both banks of the river. Isildur built Minas Ithil in a valley of the Mountains of Shadow on the border of Mordor, planting the White Tree of Gondor before his house there. Minas Ithil was a beautiful city, but it was also a stronghold to defend against the evil that might still dwell in Mordor. It was not known at first that Sauron had survived the Downfall and had begun to rebuild his strength.\\nIsildur had one of the palantÃ­r called the Ithil-stone, which he used to communicate with his brother and father. Isildur and his wife had two more sons while living in Gondor - Aratan born in SA 3339 and Ciryon born in SA 3379.\\nIn the early days of Gondor, Isildur went to the Hill of Erech at the entrance to Imlad Morthond in the White Mountains. On the hilltop he placed the Stone of Erech, a great black sphere that he had brought from NÃºmenor. Isildur met with the King of the Mountain Men, who swore allegiance to Isildur upon the Stone, but later when Isildur called upon the Men of the Mountains to join the fight against Sauron, they refused. Isildur cursed them and said that they would never rest until they fulfilled their oath, and they haunted the Paths of the Dead.[4]\\nSauron attacked and captured Minas Ithil in SA 3429. Isildur escaped with his wife and sons and a seedling of the White Tree. Isildur and his family boarded a ship at the Mouths of the Anduin and sailed around the coast of Middle-earth, seeking Elendil in Arnor. Elendil consulted with Gil-galad, the last High King of the Ã‘oldor in Middle-earth who lived in Lindon west of Arnor. Gil-galad and Elendil formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men to oppose Sauron in SA 3430. That same year, Isildur's youngest son Valandil was born at the home of Elrond in Rivendell.\\nThe Last Alliance[]\\nThe army of the Last Alliance gathered at Rivendell in SA 3431[5] and then marched to war. Isildur and his three oldest sons Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon went with the army, while Isildur's wife and their young son Valandil remained in Rivendell.\\nThe War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434. Sauron's forces were defeated in the Battle of Dagorlad on the plain outside Mordor, and the army of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and laid siege to Barad-dÃ»r.

Elendil's sword Narsil broke beneath him.\\nIsildur took up the hilt of the sword and used the broken blade to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Sauron's spirit fled from his body, but as long as the Ring that held much of his power survived so would his spirit. Enamored by the Ring's apparent beauty, Isildur took it for himself. Elrond and CÃ­rdan were the only two individuals who marked Isildur's actions, as they alone had been with Gil-galad during the contest with Sauron, and Isildur alone had stood by Elendil.[6] Not long after, with the heat-induced markings on the Ring still visible, Isildur wrote a short account of the Ring and its apparent properties, noting that it had burned his hand so badly that he believed he would be in permanent pain.

They lived at the haven of RÃ³menna on the east coast of the island of NÃºmenor. Their father was Elendil and their grandfather was Amandil, the Lord of AndÃºniÃ«. The Lords of AndÃºniÃ« were descended from the Kings of NÃºmenor through SilmariÃ«n, the daughter and eldest child of the fourth King of NÃºmenor, Tar-Elendil.[2]\\nAnÃ¡rion and Isildur (right) in their youth, by Billy Mosig\\nElros, the Half-elven and the first King of NÃºmenor, had chosen the life of Men, while his brother Elrond chose the life of Elves. Over time, the Kings of NÃºmenor grew to resent their ancestor's choice, and desired eternal life for themselves. They became estranged from the Elves and the Valar, and neglected the worship of Eru, who had created them. A small group of NÃºmenÃ³reans remained friendly with the Elves and faithful to Eru and the Valar. They were called the Faithful. Among these men were the Lords of AndÃºniÃ«.\\nIn SA 3262, Ar-PharazÃ´n, King of NÃºmenor, took Sauron captive and brought him to NÃºmenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken in order to corrupt the NÃºmenÃ³reans, to orchestrate their downfall. Over time, he succeeded in gaining influence over the NÃºmenÃ³rean authorities.\\nIsildur learned that Sauron wanted King Ar-PharazÃ´n to cut down Nimloth, the White Tree that had come from the Undying Lands. Isildur disguised himself and went secretly to the King's Court and took a fruit from Nimloth. The guards discovered and attacked him and, although receiving grave injuries, he managed to escape with the fruit. For this deed, Isildur received much praise. He stood near death for many months, but when the fruit of the White Tree began to sprout, he awoke and was recovered from his injuries.[2]\\nAs Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave NÃºmenor. They filled nine ships with their families and many of their prized possessions, including the palantÃ­ri. Isildur had three ships of his own, and he brought aboard the seedling of the White Tree, the Stone of Erech, as well as his wife and his son Elendur, who had been born in SA 3299.[1]\\nIsildur's grandfather Amandil hoped to plead with the Valar to spare the Faithful. He sailed westward toward the Undying Lands, but what became of him is not known and he was never seen again.\\nLife in Middle-earth[]\\nThe nine ships of the Faithful were spared from the tumult of NÃºmenor's downfall, and a great wind from the west sent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north with four ships, while Isildur and AnÃ¡rion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the south with three and two ships respectively. Elendil and his sons established the North-kingdom of Arnor and the South-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the High King of both realms, but he ruled from Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor to his sons.[3]\\nIsildur lived in Minas Ithil to the east of the Anduin, while AnÃ¡rion made his home in Minas Anor to the west of the Anduin. They ruled from their joint capital of Osgiliath, built on both banks of the river. Isildur built Minas Ithil in a valley of the Mountains of Shadow on the border of Mordor, planting the White Tree of Gondor before his house there. Minas Ithil was a beautiful city, but it was also a stronghold to defend against the evil that might still dwell in Mordor. It was not known at first that Sauron had survived the Downfall and had begun to rebuild his strength.\\nIsildur had one of the palantÃ­r called the Ithil-stone, which he used to communicate with his brother and father. Isildur and his wife had two more sons while living in Gondor - Aratan born in SA 3339 and Ciryon born in SA 3379.\\nIn the early days of Gondor, Isildur went to the Hill of Erech at the entrance to Imlad Morthond in the White Mountains. On the hilltop he placed the Stone of Erech, a great black sphere that he had brought from NÃºmenor. Isildur met with the King of the Mountain Men, who swore allegiance to Isildur upon the Stone, but later when Isildur called upon the Men of the Mountains to join the fight against Sauron, they refused. Isildur cursed them and said that they would never rest until they fulfilled their oath, and they haunted the Paths of the Dead.[4]\\nSauron attacked and captured Minas Ithil in SA 3429. Isildur escaped with his wife and sons and a seedling of the White Tree. Isildur and his family boarded a ship at the Mouths of the Anduin and sailed around the coast of Middle-earth, seeking Elendil in Arnor. Elendil consulted with Gil-galad, the last High King of the Ã‘oldor in Middle-earth who lived in Lindon west of Arnor. Gil-galad and Elendil formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men to oppose Sauron in SA 3430. That same year, Isildur's youngest son Valandil was born at the home of Elrond in Rivendell.\\nThe Last Alliance[]\\nThe army of the Last Alliance gathered at Rivendell in SA 3431[5] and then marched to war. Isildur and his three oldest sons Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon went with the army, while Isildur's wife and their young son Valandil remained in Rivendell.\\nThe War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434. Sauron's forces were defeated in the Battle of Dagorlad on the plain outside Mordor, and the army of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and laid siege to Barad-dÃ»r. The siege lasted seven years and many Men and Elves were killed, including Isildur's brother AnÃ¡rion, who died in SA 3440.[6]\\nIsildur taking the One Ring, after his father and Gil-galad are slain - by Ralph Damiani\\nAt last, in SA 3441, Sauron himself came down from his tower.

He theorized that the heat from Sauron's hand might have caused the writing to remain visible, and that heating it again might produce the same effect.

Celebrimbor finally fought in the War of Wrath.  Unlike some of his kin, he remained in Middle-earth afterwards.\\nSecond Age\\nCelebrimbor settled in Eregion in the Second Age and started dealing with the Dwarves of the realm of Khazad-dÃ»m. In SA 1500, Sauron, calling himself Annatar  (\"Lord of Gifts\"), befriended the Ã‘oldor of Eregion. He claimed to be an emissary of the Valar, especially AulÃ«, and instructed them in the art of ring-making.[4] Celebrimbor distrusted him, but the smiths of Eregion were deceived. Under the guidance and instruction of Sauron, the smiths openly made rings to learn the craft and Celebrimbor himself forged the three Elven rings without assistance from Sauron. But unbeknownst to him, the craft taught by Sauron incorporated a binding magic into the rings.\\nCelebrimbor and Annatar forging the Rings\\nIn secret, Sauron forged the One Ring, a master ring that would rule all the lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth via its influence over those who used the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on his finger, claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their bearers, the Elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor and the Elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings from him. The greatest of the rings (aside from the One Ring) were created by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron and thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to the One Ring. These were the three Rings of the Elves, the fairest of the Rings of Power. Celebrimbor named them Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after the principal Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water, respectively. He sent the three rings away for safekeeping: Vilya and Narya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel in LÃ³rien.

       "'Name: Aragorn II Elessar | Race: Men | Gender: Male | Realm: Reunited Kingdom,Arnor,Gondor | Birth: March 1 ,2931 | Death: FO 120 | Spouse: Arwen | Hair: Dark | Height: 198cm (6\\'6\") | Biography: Early years\\nAragorn as a toddler, portrayed by Luke Johnston in the fan film Born of Hope\\nHe was Aragorn son of Arathorn, the nine and thirtieth heir in the right line from Isildur, and yet more like Elendil than any before him.â€”The Silmarillion, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\\nAragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur through the line of the Lords of AndÃºniÃ« to Elendil, High King of Arnor and Gondor. Like all of the kings before him, he was Elrond\\'s kin through the House of Elros.  His ancestor Arvedui was wedded to FÃ­riel, descended from AnÃ¡rion, who bore their son Aranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant of both Isildur and AnÃ¡rion.\\nWhen he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while pursuing Orcs. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond. At the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn was renamed \"Estel\" and was not told about his heritage until 2951.[1]\\nYoung Aragorn with the shards of Narsil, by Anna Lee\\nElrond revealed to \"Estel\" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, giving him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil, but withholding the Sceptre of AnnÃºminas from Aragorn until he \"came of the right\" to possess the item. It was also around this time that Aragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond\\'s daughter, newly returned from her mother\\'s homeland of LothlÃ³rien where she had been visiting her grandmother Galadriel.[1]\\nAragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of the DÃºnedain and left the comforts of Rivendell for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his people, the Rangers of the North, whose kingdom had been destroyed through division and the Angmar Wars centuries before.[1]\\nAragorn met Gandalf the Grey in 2956 and they became close friends. Heeding Gandalf\\'s advice, Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small land known as the Shire inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian Hobbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the Shire\\'s borders as Strider.\\nFrom TA 2957 to TA 2980, Aragorn undertook great journeys, serving in the armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor. Many of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the growing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he earned priceless experience which he would later put to use in the War of the Ring. Aragorn served these lords in disguise and his name in Gondor and Rohan during that time was Thorongil (\"Eagle of the Star\"). With a small squadron of ships from Gondor, he led an assault on the long-standing City of the Corsairs in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs\\' ships and personally overthrowing the Captain of the Haven during a battle upon the quays. After the victory at Umbar, \"Thorongil\" left Gondor and, to the dismay of his men, went east.[2]\\nLater in 2980, he visited LothlÃ³rien, and there once again met Arwen. He gave her the heirloom of his House, the Ring of Barahir, and, on the hill of Cerin Amroth, Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage, renouncing her Elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of IlÃºvatar: Death.[1]\\nElrond withheld from Aragorn permission to marry his daughter until such a time as his foster son should be king of \"both\" Gondor and Arnor. As both Elrond and Aragorn knew, to marry a mortal, Arwen would be required to choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless Elrond of his daughter while the world lasted. Elrond was also concerned for Arwen\\'s own happiness'"
